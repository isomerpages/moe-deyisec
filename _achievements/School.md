### 2022

**2022 Innergy Bronze Award**
The team wanted to explore how the affordance of e-Pedagogy such as ArcGIS and SLS can be used to enhance:&nbsp;

1.  the teaching and of Geographical Investigation (GI) and
    
2.  students’ quality of learning in terms of student’s spatial thinking and analysis.&nbsp;
    

This e-pedagogical innovation uses ArcGIS to facilitate students’ collaborative efforts to collect weather data from 4 identified locations from around the school (i.e. the futsal court, driveway, school field and quadrangle) and present the consolidated data on a base map of the school. This helped students in the spatial visualisation of data and to make sense of spatial patterns observed.
