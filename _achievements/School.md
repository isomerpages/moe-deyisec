To better engage students, the Character and Citizenship Department in Deyi Secondary school initiated the ‘SEL Through Sports’ program. The process of acquiring a sports skill provides an excellent experiential learning platform for the inculcation of values and acquisition of social emotional competencies through authentic, teachable moments. A combination of approaches through experiential learning and teachable moments allows teachers to make use of meaningful contexts to frame social emotional learning for students.
