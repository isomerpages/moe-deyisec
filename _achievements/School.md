<p>The School Green Awards (SGA) is a voluntary environmental initiative
for schools in Singapore that provides students with a platform to create

students can enhance their understanding of environmental issues.</p>
<p>Each year, entries are received from preschools, primary schools, secondary
schools, junior colleges, international schools, and institutions catering
to students with special needs.</p>

Joaquim Award. Deyi Secondary School was awarded Vanda Miss Joaquim Awards

<h3>2022</h3>
<p><strong>2022 Innergy Bronze Award</strong> 
<br>The team wanted to explore how the affordance of e-Pedagogy such as ArcGIS
and SLS can be used to enhance:</p>
<p>1. the teaching and of Geographical Investigation (GI) and
<br>2. students’ quality of learning in terms of student’s spatial thinking
and analysis.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This e-pedagogical innovation uses ArcGIS to facilitate students’ collaborative
efforts to collect weather data from 4 identified locations from around
the school (i.e. the futsal court, driveway, school field and quadrangle)
and present the consolidated data on a base map of the school. This helped
students in the spatial visualisation of data and to make sense of spatial
patterns observed.</p>
<p><em>Congratulations to the PLC team led by Mr Lim Jun Yu, with team members Ms&nbsp;Lee Su-Min Jeanette,&nbsp;Ms Tan Boon Yen, Mr Freddy Goh and Ms Wong Kai Ping Eleanor, for winning the 2022 Innergy Bronze Award!</em>
