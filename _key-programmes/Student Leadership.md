<p><strong>Student Leadership</strong> 
<br>In Deyi, we believe that all students can lead. We have in place a rigourous
Student Leadership Development programme that seeks to inculcate in every
Deyian the knowledge, skills and values of a leader.&nbsp;Deyi adopts the
Servant Leadership model in which we believe that&nbsp;<em>to lead is to serve</em>&nbsp;and
the primary motivation to lead stems from the impetus to serve and contribute
to the community. Our Student Leaders endeavour to be role models to their
peers, are upright in character and are equipped with skills that enable
them to contribute to the betterment of their lives and those around them.</p>
<p><strong><u>Student Leadership Development Framework </u></strong>
<br>Our Deyi Student Leadership Development Framework aims to develop every&nbsp;Deyian&nbsp;into
confident leaders who contribute actively to the community.&nbsp;Deyi Student
Leaders are encouraged to serve others while staying focused on achieving
results that are in line with the School core values.</p>

<p><strong><u>Student Leadership Training Programme </u></strong>
<br>Deyi Leadership Training Programme is a four-year programme spanning from
Secondary 1 to Secondary 4.&nbsp; Deyians will be trained in leadership
knowledge and skills as well as providing them with opportunities to apply
what they have learnt. The training programmes are designed to develop
servant leadership attributes in line with our school values of Integrity,
Care, Determination, Diligence, Dedication and Discipline.</p>
<p>There are two leadership training tracks in the Deyi Leadership Training
Programme:
<br>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Self Leadership To Serve.
<br>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Team Leadership To Serve.</p>
<p>The Self Leadership&nbsp;To Serve programme&nbsp;targets all students
from Secondary 1 to Secondary 4 and is integrated into the CCE2021 Curriculum,
Level Camps and school-wide activities. It instills in our Deyians basic
skills of leadership such as time management, relationship management,
self-motivation and the awareness of the needs of their community.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;Team Leadership To Serve&nbsp;programme&nbsp;targets selected
student leaders from Secondary 2 to Secondary 4. Leadership training is
conducted through leadership camps and workshops. Students who display
strong leadership potential and a willingness to serve in a wider context
are selected by the teachers and given additional opportunities and platforms
to serve and lead.</p>
<p><strong><u>Student Leadership Opportunities </u></strong>
<br>Deyi has designed and created multiple opportunities for all Deyians to
develop their leadership qualities and skills. Various platforms are provided
for students to initiate, organise and manage events as well as projects.</p>

its staff in school operations, school events and the implementation of
