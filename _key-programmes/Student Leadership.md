**Student Leadership** <br>
In Deyi, we believe that all students can lead. We have in place a rigourous Student Leadership Development programme that seeks to inculcate in every Deyian the knowledge, skills and values of a leader. Deyi adopts the Servant Leadership model in which we believe that _to lead is to serve_ and the primary motivation to lead stems from the impetus to serve and contribute to the community. Our Student Leaders endeavour to be role models to their peers, are upright in character and are equipped with skills that enable them to contribute to the betterment of their lives and those around them.

**_Student Leadership Development Framework_** <br>
Our Deyi Student Leadership Development Framework aims to develop every Deyian into confident leaders who contribute actively to the community. Deyi Student Leaders are encouraged to serve others while staying focused on achieving results that are in line with the School core values.
