<p><strong><em>NURTURING CONFIDENT COMMUNICATORS AND GRACIOUS CITIZENS THROUGH THE ARTS</em></strong> 
<br>At Deyi, Arts Education is integral to our students' holistic development.
Guided by our mission, <em>“Arts Alive – Live, Work, Learn, and Play with the Arts”</em>,
we cultivate a vibrant arts culture that inspires students to discover
their talents and passions. Our programmes instill a love for the Arts
while building character and shaping students into gracious citizens of
tomorrow.</p>
<p>Through immersive experiences like Drama and Dance Programme, the Arts
Ambassador Programme, Aesthetic Assemblies, workshops, learning journeys,
and talent development platforms such as <em>Deyi’s Got Talent!</em> and <em>Open Mic</em>,
we promote both artistic appreciation and expertise. These opportunities
empower students to build confidence, unleash their creative potential,
celebrate their diverse talents, and pursue their artistic dreams.</p>

the arts as a powerful medium of expression. The concert highlighted how
our Performing Arts students channel their emotions, creativity, and lived
experiences into a collective heartbeat on stage.</p>
<p>Audiences were treated to captivating performances by the Deyi Band, Movement

displaying talent, the concert reaffirmed the transformative impact of
the arts, how they energise, inspire, and enrich our shared experiences.
