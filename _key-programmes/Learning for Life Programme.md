<p><strong><em>NURTURING CONFIDENT COMMUNICATORS AND GRACIOUS CITIZENS THROUGH THE ARTS</em></strong> 
<br>At Deyi, Arts Education is an integral part of our students’ holistic
development. With our mission “Arts Alive - Live, Work, Learn and Play
with the Arts”, we seek to create a vibrant arts culture through programmes
that will provide our students with opportunities to discover their interests
and talents. It also aims to nurture our students’ character and groom
them into gracious citizens of tomorrow while helping them develop their
passion for the Arts.</p>
<p>Arts Education is the focus of Deyi’s Learning for Life Programme (LLP).
Through the LLP, we cultivate a school experience that develops an appreciation
of and expertise in the arts. To support the creative dreams of our students,
we provide opportunities for them to showcase their diverse talents. This
includes our Drama-in-Curriculum (DIC) for lower secondary students, Arts
enrichment programmes, Arts Ambassador Programme and performance platforms
such as Deyi’s Arts Fiesta, Arts Hour and Deyi’s got Talent.</p>
<p><strong>Arts Fiesta</strong> 
<br>At Deyi, we firmly embrace the belief that the arts serve as a vital medium
of expression. In our commitment to nurturing creativity, this year witnessed
a dynamic exploration of diverse platforms during our biennial event -
Arts Fiesta. Our students, brimming with talent, took center stage, captivating
audiences through enthralling live performances presented by our esteemed
Deyi Band, Movement and Dance, Drama Club, Choir, Art Club, and National
Cadet Corps.</p>
<p>Arts Fiesta not only served as a stage for our students to exhibit their
remarkable talents but also became a testament to the profound impact of
the arts on our lives. Amidst the celebratory atmosphere, the event served
as a poignant reminder of how the arts, in their myriad forms, possess
the unique ability to enrich and elevate our experiences.</p>
