<p><strong>Active Voice Broadcast Journalism</strong> 
<br>Deyi’s Applied Learning Programme (ALP) has three approaches to develop
our Sec 1 to 3 students’ critical 21st century media and communications
skills. First, a whole-school approach (Tier 1) to equip students with
baseline skills on media production and journalism (e.g., storyboarding,
filming, animation, audio track layering, chroma key green screen technology,
editing, transitions, sub-titling) through the Mi-ké-mθn Video Workshop
and Mi-ké-mθn Augmented Reality Journalism Trail. Our second approach is
to integrate media production and journalism skills into the EL and MTL
curricular for better alignment with content generation and the development
of critical perspectives.</p>
<p>Students are encouraged to develop advanced media and technical skill-sets
(Tier 2) through the Young Journalists’ Club and IT Club. Students’ niche
skills are developed with Deyi’s FM Live (‘Our Channel, Our Voices’) and
live broadcasts of special events (e.g., National Day, Teachers’ Day Celebrations)
as well as technical production skills (e.g., live feeds and cutaways,
sound management).</p>

<p><strong>Nurturing Deyians to be Confident and Effective Communicators</strong> 
<br>In 2019, Deyi’s ALP received MOE’s Innergy Award (Bronze) for school innovation.
Our students have successfully gained Early Admission into all 5 tertiary
institutions (e.g., Ngee Ann, Singapore and Temasek Polytechnics’ Mass
Communications, Film and Media courses) with the broadcast journalism skill-sets
honed at Deyi.</p>
