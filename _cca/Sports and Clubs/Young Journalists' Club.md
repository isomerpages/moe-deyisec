"As a member and subsequently, as the President of the Young Journalists' Club, I have learnt to take charge and manage media projects with utmost efficiency, as well as to find my own voice. I continue to work with finesse, honing my craft in&nbsp; videography, photography and designing infographics. With the unwavering support of my teachers and fellow CCA mates, I have grown into a more outstanding individual who is ready to guide my peers and juniors in levelling up their skill sets."

**_‘If it matters to you, it matters to us.’_** 

Members of the Young Journalists’ Club embark on an exciting journey into the world of digital photography, videography, in-house deejaying and news reporting. These skills are aligned with our school’s Applied Learning Programme in Broadcasting and Journalism through language learning. Acquiring these skills, members explore social and cultural issues, serving as advocates for the student body. In doing so, they serve as a leading force and an active student voice in creating a caring and inclusive school culture. Members also get the opportunity to be appointed as emcees for school events and school reporters for both school events and external school programmes or competitions. In line with PDLP initiatives, members are also exposed to digital editorial works that are regularly published on school platforms.
