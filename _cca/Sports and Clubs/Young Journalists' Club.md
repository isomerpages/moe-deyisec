<p>The Young Journalists’ Club at Deyi Secondary School offers an immersive
foray into the dynamic fields of digital photography, videography, and
broadcasting, complementing our school’s Applied Learning Programme in
Broadcasting and Journalism. This unique club equips our eager learners
with an extensive array of skills, from technical prowess to storytelling
finesse, all through the lens of language learning. By engaging with these
disciplines, our members gain an understanding of social and cultural narratives,
positioning themselves as articulate advocates for their peers and shaping
the discourse within our community.</p>
<p>As active participants in shaping a nurturing and inclusive school environment,
members of the Young Journalists’ Club often take on pivotal roles such
as emcees or reporters during school functions, showcasing their talents
and leadership. Furthermore, in alignment with the Personalised Digital
Learning Programme (PDLP) initiatives, they contribute to the digital landscape
of our school through editorial works published across our platforms. This
hands-on experience not only hones their journalistic skills but also reinforces
their role as a vibrant, informed voice among the student body, driving
forward a culture of care and engagement.</p>
