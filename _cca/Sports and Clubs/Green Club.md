We joined Green Club(GC) for the love of our only earth and to contribute whatever we can for the environment. During our three-year journey with GC, we learnt so much about living sustainably and are given the opportunity for self-development.

<strong> Joey: </strong> “Initially, I have difficulty interacting with others. However, after working with my club members on projects, I am now more confident and even able to conduct presentation.”
<br><br>
<strong> Ivan: </strong> “Tending to our gardens under the hot sun can be unbearable. However, seeing GC members putting in their best to complete the task spurred me on. At the end of the gardening session, I felt proud of my determination to carry through a given task.”
<br><br>
<strong>Adelle:  </strong>“I learnt to take initiative and be responsible. GC has given me many opportunities to make me a better me.”

"We are thankful to GC teachers and members for the wonderful CCA experience."

**‘Greening our future’** <br>
The Green Club aims to inculcate in its members a sense of love and appreciation for the natural environment that sustains the life of all beings universally as Nature holds the key to our aesthetic, intellectual, and cognitive satisfaction. We hope to achieve this by providing our members with a range of enriching activities that will raise their awareness and concern on environmental issues and events in the school and community. This also creates opportunities for members to cherish Nature and to foster its renewal ensuring its survival. In the process, we hope to make a positive difference for the environment, to advocate an environmentally sustainable lifestyle.
