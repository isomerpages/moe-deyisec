At Deyi Secondary School, the Information and Technology (IT) Club stands
at the forefront of technological empowerment, equipping members with critical
skills for the digital age. The club's hands-on training in audio-visual
(AV) equipment operation is vital, supporting not just daily school functions
but also ensuring the smooth execution of major school events. This practical
knowledge ensures that our students are not only contributors to but also
leaders in the orchestration of our school's vibrant community events.

Aligned with the nation's forward-thinking Smart Nation initiative, the
IT Club ventures beyond traditional technology education. Under the mentorship
of seasoned robotics experts, our members dive into the fascinating world
of robotics, learning to build and program miniature robots. This innovative
program not only ignites a passion for science and engineering but also
prepares our students for future challenges in a technology-driven world,
fostering problem-solving skills, creativity, and a deeper understanding
of the technological underpinnings of our society.
