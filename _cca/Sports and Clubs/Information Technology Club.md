"In my four years in my Co-Curricular Activity (CCA), IT Club, I have learnt a few key things. Firstly, the importance of taking initiative, secondly, the power of leadership and finally, the value of voicing your opinions.

I am not an outspoken person by nature. When I first joined the school, I was more of a follower who listened to what others would like to do and say, and just did the same. As the years went by, I am proud to say that I have developed my own voice. I am also fortunate to have forged strong relationships with my peers and seniors. Many of them went on to guide me in my journey to become the chairperson of the CCA.

When I was a new member of the club, I took note of how my seniors executed the events and managed the weekly operations of the CCA. My senior challenged me and nudged me to teach my juniors all that I knew and looking back, I am grateful for his encouragement and nudge as I knew he was trying to push me to become a better version of myself. Becoming the chairperson of my CCA was not easy but thankfully, my teachers’ guidance motivated and empowered me to give my best for this CCA."

Here in Deyi Secondary School’s Information and Technology (IT) Club, members are equipped with the skills to operate audio-visual (AV) equipment which are essential for daily school activities and major school events. In line with the government’s Smart Nation initiative, our IT Club members also learn the basics of building and programming miniature robots under the guidance of an experienced robotics trainer.&nbsp;

With the easing of COVID-19 Safe Management Measures, IT Club members were able to participate in various competitions and support the execution of school events, including the Speech Day 2022 and Arts Hour 2022. Through a myriad of events and competitions, our members learn to work together as a team, developing confidence and honing their communication skills in the process.
