At Deyi Secondary School, the Information and Technology (IT) Club stands at the forefront of technological empowerment, equipping members with critical skills for the digital age. The club's hands-on training in audio-visual (AV) equipment operation is vital, supporting not just daily school functions
but also ensuring the smooth execution of major school events. This practical knowledge ensures that our students are not only contributors to but also leaders in the orchestration of our school's vibrant community events.

Aligned with the nation's forward-thinking Smart Nation initiative, the IT Club ventures beyond traditional technology education. Under the mentorship of seasoned robotics experts, our members dive into the fascinating world of robotics, learning to build and program miniature robots. This innovative program not only ignites a passion for science and engineering but also prepares our students for future challenges in a technology-driven world, fostering problem-solving skills, creativity, and a deeper understanding of the technological underpinnings of our society.
