"In the three years I have been in Track and Field, I have formed strong and long-lasting friendships as we went through thick and thin together. The teachers have also helped me hone my skills by sharing various techniques. I am now more determined as I push myself beyond my limits."

Track and Field is a CCA that offers its members a myriad of activities to engage in every Tuesday and Thursday. Students are trained not only in Track and Field events such as individual running, jumping and throwing but they are also given the opportunities to play a variety of games and sports. These activities build stamina and hone their track and field skills. It also gives them the opportunity to collaborate and bond with each other. It is a CCA where every member is accorded respect and regarded as family. This year, members were given opportunities to represent the school in friendly and national competitions.
