Volleyball has inculcated in me a sense of determination. Being new to the sport, I was initially worried about my progress in terms of skills. I stayed focused and was determined to catch up with my teammates who spurred me on. During training, I will chase after every ball and keep it up, even if it flies out of court. I am thankful to my teachers and teammates who have helped me on this enjoyable journey thus far.

**Strength of Character, Courageous in Spirit** <br>
In volleyball, players are immersed in a series of engaging activities which promotes the spirit of camaraderie. We aim to instil values and mould the character of every player. Our training emphasises on discipline, resilience, and courage to overcome challenges in life.

Every player will display discipline and model exemplary behaviour both on and off the court. They will learn to stay calm and composed in face of adversity and be adaptable; always ready to face different opponents.

The volleyball team participates yearly in the annual National School Games, the Under 14 and Under 16 competitions organized by the Volleyball Association of Singapore. Aside from participation, the team will organize an annual outreach programme at primary schools.

In October 2019, the volleyball boys went on a 5 days sports trip to Selangor, Malaysia. They trained under a foreign coach from the sports academy. The trip ended with friendly matches with the local youth players. The Volleyball boys managed to clinch first place in the friendly tournament.

Students gained invaluable experience and developed resilience in their pursuit for sporting excellence. They also learnt new training strategies, which they can share with their teammates back in Singapore.

In July 2022,  the C division Volleyball Championship resume after a 2 year hiatus. Our C division volleyball Boys created history by qualifying for the Nationals. Their efforts borne fruit when they clinch 3rd place at the South Zone C Division Volleyball Competition. The team will continue to strive for excellence in the 2023 competition.
