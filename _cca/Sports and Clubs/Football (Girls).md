I am forever grateful for my team. After all the sweat and tears we went through, the key takeaway was not being the most skilled but improving oneself and being united with the help of my coach and teachers.

The Girls’ Football team was introduced as a CCA in 2006. Our training emphasises on discipline, teamwork and commitment, which are important values on and off the field. The girls are taught football skills in a safe and friendly environment under the guidance of a dedicated coach. Our ‘B’ and ‘C’ division girls compete in football matches at national level in interschool tournaments organised by the Football Association of Singapore.
