The teachers and coaches taught my team and I to dribble, pass and shoot. Football taught us perseverance, unity, and communication. My teammates taught us to motivate and inspire one another.

The girls are taught football skills in a safe and friendly environment under the guidance of a dedicated coach. Our ‘B’ and ‘C’ division girls compete in football matches at national level in interschool tournaments organised by the Football Association of Singapore.
