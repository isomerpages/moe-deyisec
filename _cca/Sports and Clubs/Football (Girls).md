<p>Since its inception in 2006, the Girls' Football team has become a proud
tradition of our school's Co-Curricular Activities. The team's ethos is
rooted in the cultivation of discipline, teamwork, and commitment—values
that serve as the cornerstone of success both on the playing field and
in the various arenas of life. Under the tutelage of a dedicated coaching
staff, our players develop their football prowess within a nurturing and
secure environment, fostering not only their athletic abilities but also
their personal growth.
<br>The program is structured to encourage the students' competitive spirit
and sportsmanship, with our 'B' and 'C' division athletes showcasing their
skills in national-level interschool tournaments organized by the Football
Association of Singapore. This high level of play is a testament to our
players' hard work and the robust training regimen they follow. It is here,
amidst the thrill of competition and the camaraderie of their team, that
our girls shine—demonstrating the power of unity and the enduring impact
of a supportive sports education.
