"I love badminton! I am really glad that I chose it as my CCA. It has become my passion. I had a lot of fun playing and training with my fellow CCA mates. I always look forward to my badminton CCA sessions on Tuesday and Thursday.

My training comprises of a good variety of drills and exercises. It allows me to improve different aspects of my game from footwork to techniques. Sometimes our coaches and teachers would partner us and give us pieces of advice during the games to improve our techniques as well as to motivate us.&nbsp;

I feel honoured to be selected as the captain of the school badminton team. To follow through with my commitments as a team captain, I will try my best to be the most responsible and reliable person on the team as I see myself as the important link between the team and the coach and teachers.

I have the coaches and our CCA teachers to thank for inspiring me in my journey to becoming an awesome player.”

The sports also help to instil in our students the core schools values of integrity, care and diligence.
