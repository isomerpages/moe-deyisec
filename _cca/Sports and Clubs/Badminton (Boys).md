"I always look forward to my badminton CCA sessions on Tuesday and Thursday.

Although coaches and teachers are strict, they are very supportive of our needs and training. The main focus of our training is on developing our fundamental badminton skills and techniques.

I am glad I chose badminton as my CCA. In my 3 years in this CCA, I have become a much better and confident player. I have also grown stronger, fitter and more agile. I have learnt sportsmanship, discipline and teamwork and most importantly I have acquired the range of badminton skills from my coaches to be a good badminton player. I am keen to continue in my journey to improve my skills and enjoy this beautiful game of badminton even after I leave school."

The Deyi Secondary School Badminton CCA is one of the most popular sports in Deyi Secondary school. Badminton is a fast paced sport that provides our students with the mental strength to overcome challenges. The sports also help to instil in our students the core schools values of integrity, care and diligence.  
  
Practices are held twice a week at the school’s sports hall. Friendly matches also help hone their skills. In an effort to make it part of a healthy lifestyle, the players are encouraged to play badminton outside curriculum time as well. Our players have represented the school at the annual North Zone Secondary Schools Badminton Championships.  
  
Ample opportunities are given to players to showcase their leadership qualities during the annual Badminton Camp. Potential leaders are identified and trained to organise activities for the players in an effort to achieve closer bonding and team spirit.  
  
The players are taught to be persistent in terms of perfecting their skills, improving their agility as well as pushing their own boundaries and scale greater heights.
