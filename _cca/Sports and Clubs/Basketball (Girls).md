<p>The Basketball CCA at our school is a dynamic program that nurtures students
over a transformative four-year journey. From their initial introduction
to the court as freshmen, students are immersed in the foundational techniques
of basketball, including dribbling, shooting, passing, and strategic gameplay.
The programme is structured to infuse the core values of Dedication, Determination,
Diligence, and Discipline into every practice and game. Coaches are not
just instructors but mentors who guide each player with individualized
attention, ensuring that the principles of integrity and care are woven
into the fabric of their athletic education.</p>
<p>As student-athletes ascend through the program, they are continually challenged
to expand their skills and embrace leadership roles. The basketball CCA
offers a comprehensive experience that transcends traditional sports training.
Students engage in inter-school competitions that test their mettle, and
leadership endeavors that sharpen their ability to inspire and mobilise
others. By their senior year, the students have evolved into emblematic
figures of the school's ethos, demonstrating not only advanced basketball
prowess but also an unwavering commitment to the values that will empower
them to succeed in all walks of life.</p>
