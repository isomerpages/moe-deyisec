The Basketball Co-Curricular Activity (CCA) at our school is a dynamic program that nurtures students over a transformative four-year journey. From their initial introduction to the court as freshmen, students are immersed in the foundational techniques of basketball, including dribbling, shooting, passing, and strategic gameplay. The programme is meticulously structured to infuse the core values of Dedication, Discipline, Determination, and Diligence into every practice and game. Coaches are not just instructors but mentors who guide each player with individualized attention, ensuring that the principles of integrity and care are woven into the fabric of their athletic education.

As student-athletes ascend through the program, they are continually challenged to expand their skills and embrace leadership roles. The basketball CCA offers a comprehensive experience that transcends traditional sports training. Students engage in inter-school competitions that test their mettle, and leadership endeavors that sharpen their ability to inspire and mobilise others. By their senior year, the students have evolved into emblematic figures of the school's ethos, demonstrating not only advanced basketball prowess but also an unwavering commitment to the values that will empower them to succeed in all walks of life.
