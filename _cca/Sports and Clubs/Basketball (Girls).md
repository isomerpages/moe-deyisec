<p>The Basketball Co-Curricular Activity (CCA) at our school is a dynamic
program that nurtures students over a transformative four-year journey.
From their initial introduction to the court as freshmen, students are
immersed in the foundational techniques of basketball, including dribbling,
shooting, passing, and strategic gameplay. The programme is meticulously
structured to infuse the core values of Dedication, Discipline, Determination,
and Diligence into every practice and game. Coaches are not just instructors
but mentors who guide each player with individualized attention, ensuring
that the principles of integrity and care are woven into the fabric of
their athletic education.</p>
<p>As student-athletes ascend through the program, they are continually challenged
to expand their skills and embrace leadership roles. The basketball CCA
offers a comprehensive experience that transcends traditional sports training.
Students engage in inter-school competitions that test their mettle, and
leadership endeavors that sharpen their ability to inspire and mobilise
others. By their senior year, the students have evolved into emblematic
figures of the school's ethos, demonstrating not only advanced basketball
prowess but also an unwavering commitment to the values that will empower
them to succeed in all walks of life.</p>
