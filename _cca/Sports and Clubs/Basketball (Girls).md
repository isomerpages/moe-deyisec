"I aim to lead and motivate my team by providing comprehensive support, both physically and mentally.  Through Shafika's guidance, I’ve learned to be more resilient and confident, as it enables me to approach multiple problems with a positive mindset." <br>
 **~ Goh Zhi Ying**<br>


"As the basketball captain of Deyi’s team, I am not just a team player but part of a big, supportive family.  I carry a significant responsibility in motivating my teammates. I wouldn’t have been able to lead without the assurance and guidance of my team. I was once fresh, new, and unsure of how I could lead and what it meant to be carrying such a great role. But with communication and assistance from one another, there is nothing we cannot get past. Being a leader has taught me patience but most of all, I learnt how to bring my team together."<br>
**~ Shafika Gurung**<br>

**2023 Team Deyi vs Alumni Match**<br>
This match is 15 years in making with alumni playing from as far as 2008 to current students who joined the CCA in 2023. The friendly match is a powerful reminder that the team is built upon shoulders of giants and every cohort has an indelible mark on the next. The friendships that were forged in Deyi Basketball Girls can last through the years and this is something the CCA aims to foster with every batch of girls.  <br>
