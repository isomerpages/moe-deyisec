“Basketball had taught me the importance of determination and teamwork. Through my basketball journey in Deyi, I was given many opportunities to work with my teammates and we forged meaningful friendships during our time together. The teachers and friends gave me a strong sense of belonging.”

In the recent South Zone NSG competition, the B Division girls gave their best. They fought hard. The girls clearly demonstrated their determination and their immense drive in the game. The Deyi fighting spirit was blazing throughout the duration of the game. After a display of sheer resilience and sportsmanship, they placed 2nd in South Zone NSG 2022.
