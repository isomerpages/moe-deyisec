"Although I started as a beginner player, the guidance from my teachers, coach, and seniors significantly improved my skills. This CCA developed me as a skillful player and honed my leadership skills as a captain. Training together with my peers have taught me the importance of determination and teamwork."

_‘You are your only limit’_

Table Tennis is a new co-curricular activity of the school. It aims to nurture students to become players that are self-confident, determined and resilient in character. Not only that, it aims to develop students holistically to exhibit good sportsmanship and team spirit. Our students are trained with the required skills and footwork under the guidance of a dedicated coach and this would enable them to compete at the inter-school tournaments. Students can also look forward to participating in friendly matches and sports camps organised at the school level too.
