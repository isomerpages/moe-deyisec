"Throughout my Table Tennis journey in Deyi, it has been a fun yet enriching experience with many joyful moments. Table Tennis has taught me the meaning of teamwork and resilience, values which I believe are key to success in any sport. It has also given me an invaluable opportunity to develop as a student with leadership qualities. Our Table Tennis team wouldn’t be what it is without guidance from our teachers and the discipline our Coach has set for us."

_‘You are your only limit’_

Table Tennis aims to nurture students to become players who are self-confident, determined and resilient in character. Our students have demonstrated excellent sportsmanship and team spirit while performing well in recent competitions. Under the guidance of a dedicated coach, our students are able to hone their skills in the game and develop lasting friendships. Students can also look forward to competing at inter-school tournaments, participating in friendly matches and even school sports events!
