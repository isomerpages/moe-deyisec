##### Deyi Co-Curricular Programme
A holistic education provides students with a broad and deep foundation for lifelong learning. This includes learning not just in the academic areas. Equally important is the development of values and life skills in each child. This will equip the child to handle the challenges in life later on.  Co-curricular programme also supports students to discover their strengths, interests and talents.  

Our school offers a range of co-curricular programmes to help students achieve a holistic education. These programmes inculcate sound values in our students, build strength of character and foster camaraderie. They also provide opportunities for students to develop leadership qualities. Our Values-in-Action programme helps students develop qualities such as care, concern and respect for others in society.

##### Deyi Co-Curricular Activities (CCA)
CCA participation in school is compulsory for all secondary school students to enable them to have an all-round education. Students in the mandatory CCA, i.e. School Band, National Cadet Corps (NCC) and National Police Cadet Corps (NPCC), are not permitted to change their CCA throughout the secondary school years except for medical reasons, or once at the end of Secondary 1 or 2.

##### Deyi Co-Curricular Activities (CCA) Days
Our school’s CCA days\* are on **Tuesday** and **Thursday**. Each session is compulsory and will last about 2.5 – 3 hours.

The above information is presented in each student’s timetable. On Tuesday and Thursday, PM Recess is scheduled for the respective levels. Students will have their lunch in the school canteen. They will then report to their CCAs at 3.00pm sharp.

\*Schedule might vary due to competition/SYF requirements and other special activities.
