<p>The St. John Brigade at our school is a vital community dedicated to empowering
our youth with life-saving First Aid skills, including CPR and the use
of AEDs. Our mission extends far beyond the acquisition of these critical
skills; we aim to nurture our cadets holistically, fostering growth in
moral, cognitive, physical, social, and aesthetic domains. Our ultimate
goal is to shape our cadets into well-rounded and successful individuals,
ready to make meaningful contributions to society.</p>
<p>Leadership and integrity are at the core of our ethos. We believe in developing
leaders who are not only responsible and mission-driven but also proficient
in self-management. To this end, the St. John Headquarters offers foundational
and advanced leadership courses, such as the Basic and Advanced Non-Commissioned
Officer Course, specifically designed to enhance the leadership qualities
of our cadets. Through a blend of rigorous training, events, and courses,
we instill in our cadets the importance of managing oneself, emphasizing
that effective leadership begins with self-discipline and self-care. By
equipping our cadets with these essential skills and values, we prepare
them to lead with confidence and compassion, both within the Brigade and
in their future endeavors.</p>
