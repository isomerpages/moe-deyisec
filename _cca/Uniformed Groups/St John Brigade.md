The St. John Brigade at our school is a vital community dedicated to empowering our youth with life-saving First Aid skills, including CPR and the use of AEDs. Our mission extends far beyond the acquisition of these critical skills; we aim to nurture our cadets holistically, fostering growth in moral, cognitive, physical, social, and aesthetic domains. Our ultimate goal is to shape our cadets into well-rounded and successful individuals, ready to make meaningful contributions to society.

Leadership and integrity are at the core of our ethos. We believe in developing leaders who are not only responsible and mission-driven but also proficient in self-management. To this end, the St. John Headquarters offers foundational and advanced leadership courses, such as the Basic and Advanced Non-Commissioned Officer Course, specifically designed to enhance the leadership qualities of our cadets. Through a blend of rigorous training, events, and courses, we instill in our cadets the importance of managing oneself, emphasizing that effective leadership begins with self-discipline and self-care. By equipping our cadets with these essential skills and values, we prepare them to lead with confidence and compassion, both within the Brigade and in their future endeavors.
