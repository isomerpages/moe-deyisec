"Here in the National Police Cadet Corps, I feel that we are expanding our knowledge&nbsp;every training by stepping out of our comfort zone and pushing our boundaries. Through&nbsp;this, we learn resilience, courage and to adapt along the way, I feel that this is useful as&nbsp;these are skills that we need in the future. I appreciate the emphasis on these values&nbsp;and with guidance from our Instructors and Teacher Officers, it helps us be better&nbsp;people with good character.
<br><br>
I am glad that I joined this CCA as I have met a unique group of people that I work well&nbsp;with and will remember for life. I will forever treasure the memories, skills, and lessons taught to me. Despite a plethora of CCAs to choose from, I cannot imagine myself in&nbsp;another CCA but NPCC."

**Deyi NPCC** <br>
Deyi NPCC Unit aims to train cadets to be responsible and caring citizens, in alignment with MOE’s Student Outcomes. As such, cadets participate in annual Values-in-Action programmes such as the Community Safety and Security Project and Police Youth Ambassador Project to reach out to the community, enabling them to become Concerned Citizens and Active Contributors. In addition, meaningful activities/courses like Standard First Aid, Kayaking, Cadet Leader Camp are conducted for the cadets to learn life skills and develop their leadership potential so as to become Confident Persons. To enhance and enrich cadets’ experience with Deyi NPCC Unit, courses, educational visits and attachments will also be organised over the span of their secondary school years. These include courses like Civil Defence, Police Knowledge, Crime Scene Investigation, Anti-Narcotics, Road Safety, as well as visits to the Neighbourhood Police Centre, Police Heritage Centre, K9 Unit, Police Coast Guard Unit and Criminal Investigation Department. With integrity, care, diligence, discipline, determination and dedication, Deyi NPCC Unit had been awarded the 13th consecutive year Gold Award for the annual Unit Overall Proficiency Award from the years 2009 – 2021.
