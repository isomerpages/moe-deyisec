"As the training head for the Secondary 2 squad in Deyi NPCC, I have learnt how to communicate effectively with my junior cadets and squad mates. Moreover, I have learnt how to work effectively as a team in the face of challenges. I appreciate how my squad mates support me when I need help and the valuable advice my teacher officers and cadet inspectors have given me throughout my NPCC journey so far. I have learnt to be more matured and patient as compared to my old self in lower Secondary and I owe this to my CCA in providing me with the opportunities to grow."

**Deyi NPCC** <br>
Deyi NPCC Unit aims to train cadets to be responsible and caring citizens, in alignment with MOE’s Student Outcomes. As such, cadets participate in annual Values-in-Action programmes such as the Community Safety and Security Project and Police Youth Ambassador Project to reach out to the community, enabling them to become Concerned Citizens and Active Contributors. In addition, meaningful activities/courses like Standard First Aid, Kayaking, Cadet Leader Camp are conducted for the cadets to learn life skills and develop their leadership potential so as to become Confident Persons. To enhance and enrich cadets’ experience with Deyi NPCC Unit, courses, educational visits and attachments will also be organised over the span of their secondary school years. These include courses like Civil Defence, Police Knowledge, Crime Scene Investigation, Anti-Narcotics, Road Safety, as well as visits to the Neighbourhood Police Centre, Police Heritage Centre, K9 Unit, Police Coast Guard Unit and Criminal Investigation Department. With integrity, care, diligence, discipline, determination and dedication, Deyi NPCC Unit had been awarded the 12th consecutive year Gold Award for the annual Unit Overall Proficiency Award from the years 2009 – 2020.
