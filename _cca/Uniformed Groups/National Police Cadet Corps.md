<p>The Deyi NPCC Unit is committed to molding cadets into responsible and
compassionate individuals, aligning with the Ministry of Education's (MOE)
desired Student Outcomes. By actively participating in Values-in-Action
programmes, such as the Community Safety and Security Project and the Police
Youth Ambassador Project, our cadets step into roles that allow them to
make meaningful contributions to society, embodying the ideals of being
Concerned Citizens and Active Contributors.</p>
<p>Beyond community engagement, the NPCC Unit at Deyi offers a plethora of
activities and courses designed to equip cadets with essential life skills
and foster their leadership qualities, guiding them on their journey to
becoming confident persons. From Standard First Aid and Kayaking to the
Cadet Leader Camp, these experiences are carefully curated to challenge
cadets, promote personal growth, and unlock their leadership potential.</p>
<p>To further enrich the cadets' journey, the Deyi NPCC Unit organizes a
comprehensive array of courses, educational visits, and attachments throughout
their secondary school years. These immersive experiences include specialized
courses in Civil Defence, Police Knowledge, Crime Scene Investigation,
Anti-Narcotics, and Road Safety, as well as exploratory visits to key law
enforcement facilities like the Neighbourhood Police Centre, Police Heritage
Centre, K9 Unit, Police Coast Guard Unit, and the Criminal Investigation
Department. Each opportunity is designed to expand the cadets' horizons,
deepen their understanding of law enforcement, and enhance their NPCC experience.</p>
