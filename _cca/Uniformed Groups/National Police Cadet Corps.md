The Deyi NPCC Unit is committed to molding cadets into responsible and compassionate individuals, aligning with the Ministry of Education's (MOE) desired Student Outcomes. By actively participating in Values-in-Action programmes, such as the Community Safety and Security Project and the Police Youth Ambassador Project, our cadets step into roles that allow them to make meaningful contributions to society, embodying the ideals of being Concerned Citizens and Active Contributors.

Beyond community engagement, the NPCC Unit at Deyi offers a plethora of activities and courses designed to equip cadets with essential life skills and foster their leadership qualities, guiding them on their journey to becoming confident persons. From Standard First Aid and Kayaking to the Cadet Leader Camp, these experiences are carefully curated to challenge cadets, promote personal growth, and unlock their leadership potential.

To further enrich the cadets' journey, the Deyi NPCC Unit organizes a comprehensive array of courses, educational visits, and attachments throughout their secondary school years. These immersive experiences include specialized courses in Civil Defence, Police Knowledge, Crime Scene Investigation, Anti-Narcotics, and Road Safety, as well as exploratory visits to key law enforcement facilities like the Neighbourhood Police Centre, Police Heritage Centre, K9 Unit, Police Coast Guard Unit, and the Criminal Investigation Department. Each opportunity is designed to expand the cadets' horizons, deepen their understanding of law enforcement, and enhance their NPCC experience.
