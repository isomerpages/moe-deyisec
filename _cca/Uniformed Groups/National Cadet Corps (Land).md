<p>Deyi Secondary School's National Cadet Corps (NCC) is dedicated to molding
future leaders and fostering a spirit of dedicated citizenship among its
members. Anchored in the NCC's strategic pillars of Leadership, Fitness,
and a deep-seated Commitment to Singapore, our program is tailored to empower
cadets through a comprehensive development framework. At the heart of our
mission are the Corps' eight foundational values: Loyalty to Singapore,
Uprightness, Leadership, Discipline, Commitment &amp; Responsibility, Care
for Fellow Cadets, Adventurous Spirit, and Safety.</p>
<p>Through a curriculum that emphasizes these principles, we strive to instill
a sense of honor, integrity, and responsibility in our cadets. Our approach
is designed not only to cultivate strong, capable leaders but also to encourage
them to become compassionate and committed citizens who contribute positively
to society. By engaging in a range of activities that challenge and develop
their abilities, cadets at Deyi Secondary School's NCC experience a rich
journey of personal growth and community service.</p>
