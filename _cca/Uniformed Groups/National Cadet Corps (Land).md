Deyi Secondary School's National Cadet Corps (NCC) is dedicated to molding future leaders and fostering a spirit of dedicated citizenship among its members. Anchored in the NCC's strategic pillars of Leadership, Fitness, and a deep-seated Commitment to Singapore, our program is tailored to empower cadets through a comprehensive development framework. At the heart of our mission are the Corps' eight foundational values: Loyalty to Singapore, Uprightness, Leadership, Discipline, Commitment &amp; Responsibility, Care for Fellow Cadets, Adventurous Spirit, and Safety.

Through a curriculum that emphasizes these principles, we strive to instill a sense of honor, integrity, and responsibility in our cadets. Our approach is designed not only to cultivate strong, capable leaders but also to encourage them to become compassionate and committed citizens who contribute positively to society. By engaging in a range of activities that challenge and develop their abilities, cadets at Deyi Secondary School's NCC experience a rich journey of personal growth and community service.
