Renowned for its superb showmanship and innovative performances, the Deyi Marching Band is a household name that is synonymous with excellence. Formed in 1980 and skillfully led since its founding by music director Mrs Chee-Say Ken Shen, the Band has achieved many distinguished awards and outstanding results at the Singapore Youth Festival.

A comprehensive training programme has been put in place to build musicianship and to nurture the school values of Dedication, Determination, Diligence and Discipline in every member. The Band members are given ample opportunities to maximise their creative energy for building character and nurturing their talents through professional tutoring. Here in Deyi Band, every member is a leader where each individual is nurtured in leadership skills, bringing out the leader in them.

The Band’s motto, ‘Spirito Obbligato’, was introduced in 1988. It reflects the Band’s commitment to making inspirational music, delightful and accessible to all. At the end of the 4-year journey, we envision to produce independent, skillful, passionate and confident performers in our members.
