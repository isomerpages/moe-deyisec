The Deyi Art Club is a welcoming and safe haven for students talented in visual arts to gather and stretch their artistic potential via meaningful art experiences. Opportunities are given to our students to explore new art forms and techniques. Traditional and non-traditional mediums are offered to allow our students to express themselves freely and expand their creativity and resourcefulness. Platforms to hone public-speaking skills, appreciate different art forms and collaborate as a team on school projects are always provided to our members, as we recognize the importance of inculcating 21-Century Competencies in our talents.   

**Teachers-in-charge:**  
Mr Alvin Khoo (OIC)  
Miss Carol Chong (AIC)  
Ms Oh Jia Ling Amelia  
  

**Weekly Schedule:**  
Odd Week Tuesdays, Even Week Tuesdays and Even Week Thursdays

**Achievements and Highlights:**
* Niche Programme: Sand Art 

Under tutelage of Ms Oscar Ng, our Sand Art artists demonstrated their talents in front of a live audience during Arts Fiesta concert, a biennial and ticketed event held by our school. 


* Young Artists Leadership Programme (YALP)

YALP is a mentoring and skills-sharing platform for senior art club members to mentor their juniors, work as a team and impart the skills of an art form they are passionate about to the rest of the club.  Members were exposed to myriad of art forms through YALP, from pour art, observational drawing, marbling art to manga art

**External Competitions**

* Live-on Festival Design Competition (LODC)

The “Live On Festival - Design Competition” was launched in 2018 with the objective to increase engagement of organ donation and transplantation amongst Singapore residents. LODC also seeks to inculcate the values of responsibility, compassion and empathy amongst all participants through their research and creation phase where they gain insights on organ donation and transplantation. Winning artworks from the competition are printed on National Organ Transplant Unit (NOTU) collaterals and distributed at their publicity events across Singapore.

We are very proud to announce that one of our talents, Zhuang Zhiqing from Class 2 Resilience has emerged Top 3 in this nationwide event.

This is her writeup on her winning artwork:

“This artwork is about a little girl bringing her kidney to an amusement park for their last journey together. As the kidney is failing, she needs to take the IV drip to sustain its health. This is the main reason why the little girl is tearing. There were presents given to the little girl to wish her good luck and provide moral support. However, the night scene and greyish brown plant signifies that the girl has not much time left. Like the withering roses and beautiful butterfly that is slowing losing its colour, it is obvious that the kidney will “raise the white flag” eventually, it’s just a matter of time.”

This is Jing En’s writeup on her winning artwork:
“My drawing suggests that the earth is slowly dying, forests are slowly burnt down, and people are protesting to save the earth. Although the earth as existed for a long time, the amount of time it has left will be shortened, and if we continue to not care about the earth, life on earth to cease to exist.”

This is Mabel’s writeup on her winning artwork:

“My artwork represents the lengths people will go to gain more money, even if it means sacrificing our planet. Instead of squeezing our earth to the brink of death, we should embrace it and be more sustainable, going forward. I hope this artwork will expose people to the grim reality of compromising our earth for money, depleting its natural resources and forests.”

<u>Top 3 finalist: Liang Jinghan (1 Resilience) </u>

This is Jinghan’s writeup on her winning artwork:

“The Earth is like a human heart: it will never stop working unless it is in a bad condition. The earth is like our home, and it will always be. We need to protect our forests. Without them, we will not be able to survive, and earth will perish too. “

**School events: **
* National Day Celebrations
As a collaborative effort between the Art Club and the National Education committee, our talents made use of recyclable materials to create an installation art of The Merlion. The student population was invited to paint colourful stars on the installation to convey their well-wishes for our nation.

Appreciation of South-east Asian art at the National Gallery of Singapore. 

In our teachers’ hopes to increase exposure and interest in Southeast Asian art in our students, a learning journey to the National Gallery of Singapore was conducted. Volunteer museum curators led our talents into various galleries and gave them insights on the various Southeast Asian artists’ perspectives on their artworks.
