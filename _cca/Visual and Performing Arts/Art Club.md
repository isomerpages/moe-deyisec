<p>The Deyi Art Club is a welcoming and safe haven for students talented
in visual arts to gather and stretch their artistic potential via meaningful
art experiences. Opportunities are given to our students to explore new
art forms and techniques. Traditional and non-traditional mediums are offered
to allow our students to express themselves freely and expand their creativity
and resourcefulness. Platforms to hone public-speaking skills, appreciate
different art forms and collaborate as a team on school projects are always
provided to our members, as we recognize the importance of inculcating
21-Century Competencies in our talents.</p>
