"Before becoming the Art club president, one of the challenges I faced was my doubts. I was lucky enough to have met my friends, despite the different classes and levels and they were very supportive. With this leadership opportunity, I grew confident and courageous to lead and guide my peers in our artistic journey together." 
<br><br> 
<strong> Yeoh Liu Ying&nbsp;(Class 404) <br> Art Club President </strong>
	


The Art Club is built on a commitment to foster and inspire the young and talented artists. Art Club provides various avenues and platforms for the holistic development of students with a common interest in Art.

Students are engaged through the different art forms such as Batik, Ceramics, Painting, Digital Art, and High Art fashion to achieve the overarching objectives of lifelong learning and character building.

This mix of traditional and non-traditional mediums allow our students to express themselves freely and expand their creativity and resourcefulness. Students in Art Club are exposed to different art styles, artists and art movements through visits to art galleries and museums whenever possible to increase students’ appreciation and awareness of Art.

**External Competitions**

* Live-on Festival Design Competition (LODC)

The “Live On Festival - Design Competition” was launched in 2018 with the objective to increase engagement of organ donation and transplantation amongst Singapore residents. LODC also seeks to inculcate the values of responsibility, compassion and empathy amongst all participants through their research and creation phase where they gain insights on organ donation and transplantation. Winning artworks from the competition are printed on National Organ Transplant Unit (NOTU) collaterals and distributed at their publicity events across Singapore.

We are very proud to announce that one of our talents, Zhuang Zhiqing from Class 2 Resilience has emerged Top 3 in this nationwide event.

This is her writeup on her winning artwork:

“This artwork is about a little girl bringing her kidney to an amusement park for their last journey together. As the kidney is failing, she needs to take the IV drip to sustain its health. This is the main reason why the little girl is tearing. There were presents given to the little girl to wish her good luck and provide moral support. However, the night scene and greyish brown plant signifies that the girl has not much time left. Like the withering roses and beautiful butterfly that is slowing losing its colour, it is obvious that the kidney will “raise the white flag” eventually, it’s just a matter of time.”

This is Jing En’s writeup on her winning artwork:
“My drawing suggests that the earth is slowly dying, forests are slowly burnt down, and people are protesting to save the earth. Although the earth as existed for a long time, the amount of time it has left will be shortened, and if we continue to not care about the earth, life on earth to cease to exist.”

This is Mabel’s writeup on her winning artwork:

“My artwork represents the lengths people will go to gain more money, even if it means sacrificing our planet. Instead of squeezing our earth to the brink of death, we should embrace it and be more sustainable, going forward. I hope this artwork will expose people to the grim reality of compromising our earth for money, depleting its natural resources and forests.”

<u>Top 3 finalist: Liang Jinghan (1 Resilience) </u>

This is Jinghan’s writeup on her winning artwork:

“The Earth is like a human heart: it will never stop working unless it is in a bad condition. The earth is like our home, and it will always be. We need to protect our forests. Without them, we will not be able to survive, and earth will perish too. “

**School events: **
* National Day Celebrations
As a collaborative effort between the Art Club and the National Education committee, our talents made use of recyclable materials to create an installation art of The Merlion. The student population was invited to paint colourful stars on the installation to convey their well-wishes for our nation.
