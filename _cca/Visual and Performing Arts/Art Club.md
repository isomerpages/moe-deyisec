"Before becoming the Art club president, one of the challenges I faced was my doubts. I was lucky enough to have met my friends, despite the different classes and levels and they were very supportive. With this leadership opportunity, I grew confident and courageous to lead and guide my peers in our artistic journey together." 
<br><br> 
<strong> Yeoh Liu Ying&nbsp;(Class 404) <br> Art Club President </strong>
	


The Art Club is built on a commitment to foster and inspire the young and talented artists. Art Club provides various avenues and platforms for the holistic development of students with a common interest in Art.

Students are engaged through the different art forms such as Batik, Ceramics, Painting, Digital Art, and High Art fashion to achieve the overarching objectives of lifelong learning and character building.

This mix of traditional and non-traditional mediums allow our students to express themselves freely and expand their creativity and resourcefulness. Students in Art Club are exposed to different art styles, artists and art movements through visits to art galleries and museums whenever possible to increase students’ appreciation and awareness of Art.
