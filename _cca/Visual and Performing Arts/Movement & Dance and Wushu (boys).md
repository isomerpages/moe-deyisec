"Over the four years that I have been in Wushu, I have grown immensely, both physically and morally. Respect, Resilience, Courage and Discipline are just a few of the many life values that the instructors and teachers have instilled in me and the other Wushu members. The Wushu CCA has developed us holistically, beyond the classroom and academics."

"M&D has always been a platform where I can hone my dance skills as well as life skills, outside of my academics. Being a part of this CCA has increased my self-awareness and social-awareness. I appreciate how important teamwork is in achieving a common goal. My instructors have also encouraged me to try new things, stretching my limits and letting me discover my true potential."
