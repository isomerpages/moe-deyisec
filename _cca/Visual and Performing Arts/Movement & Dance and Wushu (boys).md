At Deyi Secondary School, the Movement &amp; Dance and Wushu CCA provides a vibrant platform for students to delve into and refine their artistic and martial arts skills. This CCA is designed to offer students a comprehensive exploration of their interests, allowing them to discover and nurture their innate talents. Through dedicated training sessions and numerous performance opportunities, core values such as discipline, determination, and self-confidence are seamlessly integrated into the learning experience. Additionally, students gain a graceful demeanor and develop an enriched appreciation for the arts, encompassing music, movement, and dance, and enhance their aesthetic sensibility.

In 2018, the Wushu Boys team emerged as a specialised extension of the Movement and Dance CCA, with a mission to safeguard and celebrate the rich heritage of this traditional Chinese art form. Since its inception, the team has shown remarkable progress, embodying the essence of Wushu through the mastery of disciplines such as 拳术 (fist techniques), 剑术 (sword techniques), and 棍术 (long staff techniques). Participating in Wushu not only strengthens students physically but also nurtures them mentally, emotionally, and spiritually, offering a holistic approach to personal development. This fusion of culture and athleticism showcases the dynamic spirit of our students and reflects the CCA's commitment to fostering well-rounded individuals.

Recent highlights include the 2023 SYF Arts Presentation Judging, where our dancers represented the school with items in the International and Chinese Dance categories. They performed the ambitious choreography with grace and poise and persevered through challenges to attain Distinctions in both categories. Our dancers also collaborated with the Deyi Military Band to perform in the 2023 National Day Parade.
