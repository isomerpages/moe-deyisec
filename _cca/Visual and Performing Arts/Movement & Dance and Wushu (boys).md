"Over the four years that I have been in Wushu, I have grown immensely, both physically and morally. Respect, Resilience, Courage and Discipline are just a few of the many life values that the instructors and teachers have instilled in me and the other Wushu members. The Wushu CCA has developed us holistically, beyond the classroom and academics."

"M&D has always been a platform where I can hone my dance skills as well as life skills, outside of my academics. Being a part of this CCA has increased my self-awareness and social-awareness. I appreciate how important teamwork is in achieving a common goal. My instructors have also encouraged me to try new things, stretching my limits and letting me discover my true potential."

Deyi Secondary School’s Movement & Dance and Wushu aim to give students the exposure to explore their interests and hone their talents. Through training and opportunities to perform, our school values such as discipline, determination and self-confidence are instilled in our students. Through the CCA, students also learn to carry themselves with elegance and poise, as well as to embrace an appreciation for the arts in the areas of music, movement and dance.

In 2018, the Wushu Boys team was established as a branch of the Movement and Dance Club to preserve and promote the cultural art form. Through the practice of traditional 

Chinese martial arts, students are exposed to and learn a wide range of movements and techniques, such as 拳术 (fists)，剑术 (sword) and 棍术 (long staff). This competitive sport builds our students up physically, mentally, emotionally and spiritually.

Our students participated in the 2021 SYF Arts Presentation with a total of 4 dance items in the International Dance and Chinese Dance categories. Our students had done us proud with their performances. The grit they had shown while keeping up with the changes in the COVID-19 situation was admirable.
