Deyi Secondary School’s Movement &amp; Dance and Wushu aim to give students the exposure to explore their interests and hone their talents. Through training and opportunities to perform, our school values such as discipline, determination and self-confidence are instilled in our students. Through the CCA, students also learn to carry themselves with elegance and poise, as well as to embrace an appreciation for the arts in the areas of music, movement and dance.

In 2018, the Wushu Boys team was established as a branch of the Movement and Dance Club to preserve and promote the cultural art form. Since then, it has grown from strength to strength. Through the practice of traditional Chinese martial arts, students are exposed to and learn a wide range of movements and techniques, such as 拳术 (fists)，剑术 (sword) and 棍术 (long staff). This competitive sport builds our students up physically, mentally, emotionally and spiritually.

In the 2023 SYF Arts Presentation judging, our dancers represented the school with items in the International and Chinese Dance categories. They performed the ambitious choreography with grace and poise, and persevered through challenges to earn Distinctions in both categories.
