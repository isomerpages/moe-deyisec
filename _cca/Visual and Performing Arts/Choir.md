  The Deyi Choir is dedicated to immersing students in the profound beauty and traditions of choral music. Through this enriching journey, students are encouraged to cultivate a deep appreciation for vocal harmony and the collaborative spirit of choir performance. Emphasizing values such as responsibility, camaraderie, discipline, and a passionate dedication to singing, the choir seeks to nurture not just musicians but well-rounded individuals.

In addition to vocal training, members are given the unique opportunity to develop leadership skills by taking on administrative and musical direction roles within the CCA. This hands-on approach to management and artistic guidance prepares them for leadership in various contexts. Performance opportunities, both within the school and in external venues, offer students the chance to showcase their talent and hard work. As they participate in competitions, the focus remains on achieving excellence and representing their school with pride. Through these experiences, Deyi Choir members embark on a journey of personal growth, artistic expression, and communal achievement.
