singing .With the support from my CCA friends, teachers and conductor, I have overcome
challenges faced during sectional practices. This year, choir have done many amazing
performances and I am proud of our achievements. Choir has helped build my self-
confidence and I am thankful for all the opportunities that are given to me ”.<br> <br>

Deyi Choir aims for our students to appreciate the rich traditions of choral music, demonstrate a strong sense of responsibility, camaraderie, discipline, passion for singing, and develop as student leaders to manage the CCA administratively as well as provide musical directions. They also get to experience what it is like to perform within and outside of school as they strive towards achieving excellent results in competitions.
