<p>The Deyi Choir is dedicated to immersing students in the profound beauty
and traditions of choral music. Through this enriching journey, students
are encouraged to cultivate a deep appreciation for vocal harmony and the
collaborative spirit of choir performance. Emphasizing values such as responsibility,
camaraderie, discipline, and a passionate dedication to singing, the choir
seeks to nurture not just musicians but well-rounded individuals.</p>
<p>In addition to vocal training, members are given the unique opportunity
to develop leadership skills by taking on administrative and musical direction
roles within the CCA. This hands-on approach to management and artistic
guidance prepares them for leadership in various contexts. Performance
opportunities, both within the school and in external venues, offer students
the chance to showcase their talent and hard work. As they participate
in competitions, the focus remains on achieving excellence and representing
their school with pride. Through these experiences, Deyi Choir members
embark on a journey of personal growth, artistic expression, and communal
achievement.</p>
