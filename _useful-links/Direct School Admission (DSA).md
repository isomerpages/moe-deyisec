<h3>Background</h3>

</p>
<p>Starting from the 2018 DSA Exercise (for the 2018 P6 cohort), secondary
schools will be able to take in up to 20% of their intake through the DSA.
This expansion allows more students to be admitted directly into schools
that can better nurture their strengths and interests through specific
programmes.</p>
<h3>Centralised DSA-Sec Application Process&nbsp;</h3>
<p><a href="#backtotop" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Back to top</a>

<p><strong>Visual and Performing Arts</strong>
</p>
</td>
<td rowspan="1" colspan="1">
<p>Since 2005, the Performing Arts have been an area of strength in Deyi.
In 2016, we integrated our arts education programmes with our Learning
for Life Programme (LLP) - NURTURING CONFIDENT COMMUNICATORS AND GRACIOUS
CITIZENS THROUGH THE ARTS. The LLP focuses on real-life experiential learning
to develop students’ character and values through various in-curriculum
Arts programmes such as Drama, Dance, Visual Art and Music.
<br>
<br>To develop every child to the fullest, Deyi aims to bring the Performing
Arts to the entire school population.
<br>
<br>The desired outcomes we envision for all Deyians in the areas of LLP are:
<br>
<br>• To be more culturally aware and appreciative of the various forms of
performing arts;
<br>• To learn at least one 'performing art' skill (i.e. to be able to dance,
act or sing reasonably well);
<br>• To perform in at least one school / public performance.
<br>
<br>Thus Performing Arts @ Deyi is about values inculcation, holistic development
of the child, expanding the common space amidst our rich and diverse cultural
heritage and fostering social responsibility so that our students will
become Active Learners, Gracious Citizens.
<br>
<br>All selected students will be recruited into Visual &amp; Performing Arts-related
CCAs namely, Art Club, School Band, Choir, Movement &amp; Dance, and English
Drama Club for a customised Talent Development Programme.</p>

frontiers. Underlying all these is the courage to make a difference to

for Life Programme (LLP) is Visual and Performing Arts which seeks to nurture
confident communicators and gracious citizens.</p>
<p>As part of our IT Enrichment Programme, students can also look forward

in the school.</p>
<p>Our comprehensive range of core and enrichment programmes also include

<p><strong>5. How heavily involved will my child be in this CCA and what academic assistance will you provide my child?</strong> 
<br>Training and practices for the various CCAs are held 2 times a week. The
frequency and intensity will increase nearing competition season. The school
has an academic monitoring system in place to identify students that require
remediation and academic guidance.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>6. Will there be additional fees?</strong> 
<br>There will not be any additional fees beyond our current standard practice:</p>
<p>The school will provide for the basic requirements (e.g. musical instruments,
costumes, etc).</p>
<p>Additional items such as special training courses, overseas cultural exchanges,
etc will be heavily subsidised by the school, but students will be expected
to bear a certain percentage of the costs. The students' Edusave funds
can usually be tapped for this purpose.</p>

difficulties. We will endeavour to work out a suitable arrangement to ensure
that anyone who qualifies on merit for any opportunity is able to take
it up.</p>

<h5>General FAQs on the DSA – Sec Exercise</h5>
<p><strong>1. What is DSA - Sec Exercise?</strong> 
<br>The DSA-Sec Exercise was first introduced in 2004 as part of MOE's move
towards a more flexible and broad-based education system. Under the DSA-Sec
Exercise, schools will be able to select a percentage of their students
for admission outside of the centralised posting system, via their own
selection criteria. These criteria can include diverse academic and non-academic
achievements and talents.</p>
<p><strong>2. How much flexibility is given to schools to select their students?</strong> 
<br>In general, schools can decide on their admission criteria, so long as
they are meritocratic and transparent.</p>
<p><strong>3. How will the students be admitted into the participating schools?</strong> 
<br>Students who meet the school-based admission criteria will be made a Confirmed
Offer or placed on the Waiting List by the school. Students given a Confirmed
Offer are guaranteed a place in the school, in a course [Express, Normal
(Academic) or Normal (Technical)] which the student is eligible for. This
is based on the PSLE aggregate of the student.</p>
<p>Students placed on the Waiting List are not guaranteed a place and their
admission will be based on available vacancies.</p>
<p>Students on the Rejected List are deemed rejected by the school. However,
they may still opt for the school during the S1 Posting Exercise.</p>
<p><strong>4. Can a student receive more than 1 confirmed offer?</strong> 
<br>Yes. MOE will consolidate all the offers the student has received from
the various schools in the School Preference Form which will be sent to
the student. Candidates who have been identified under the Confirmed List
and the Waiting List of a school will be asked to indicate their preference
for up to a maximum of 3 schools. This will be done at their Primary schools.
Amendments or cancellations will not be allowed after the closure of the
Exercise School Preference Stage.</p>
<p><strong>5. When will the student know the outcome of his choice?</strong> 
<br>Candidates currently studying in our MOE schools will be informed of their
DSA allocation results together with the release of PSLE results through
their primary schools. Other candidates (currently not studying in our
MOE schools) will have to collect their DSA allocation results from MOE
HQ Customer Service Centre, located in 1 North Buona Vista Drive, Podium
Block MOE Building, S(138675).</p>
<p>Successful DSA Candidates will be issued with a Direct Admission Slip,
informing them of the school that had accepted them. These students will
not be allowed to make any school selection in the centralised S1 Posting
Exercise. Unsuccessful DSA Candidates will also be issued with a S1 Option
Form, informing them that their DSA application had been unsuccessful.
These students must complete their S1 Option Form and submit it to their
primary school.</p>
<p><strong>6. Will there be enough places for students who wish to enrol in the school via the Sec 1 Posting Exercise?</strong> 
<br>As there is a cap of&nbsp;20%&nbsp;for Deyi Secondary's enrolment under
DSA-Sec exercise there will still be 80% of places available for enrolment
under the Sec 1 Posting Exercise.</p>
