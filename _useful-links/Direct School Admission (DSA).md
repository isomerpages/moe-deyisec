| | | |
|---|---|---|
| Visual and Performing Arts | Since 2005, the Performing Arts have been an area of strength in Deyi. In 2016, we integrated our arts education programmes with our Learning for Life Programme (LLP) - NURTURING CONFIDENT COMMUNICATORS AND GRACIOUS CITIZENS THROUGH THE ARTS. The LLP focuses on real-life experiential learning to develop students’ character and values through various in-curriculum Arts programmes such as Drama, Dance, Visual Art and Music.  <br> <br> To develop every child to the fullest, Deyi aims to bring the Performing Arts to the entire school population.  <br><br> The desired outcomes we envision for all Deyians in the areas of LLP are: <br><br>• To be more culturally aware and appreciative of the various forms of performing arts; <br>• To learn at least one 'performing art' skill (i.e. to be able to dance, act or sing reasonably well); <br> • To perform in at least one school / public performance. <br><br> Thus Performing Arts @ Deyi is about values inculcation, holistic development of the child, expanding the common space amidst our rich and diverse cultural heritage and fostering social responsibility so that our students will become Active Learners, Gracious Citizens. <br><br> All selected students will be recruited into Visual &amp; Performing Arts-related CCAs namely, Art Club, School Band, Choir, Movement &amp; Dance, and English Drama Club for a customised Talent Development Programme. |
| Media/Journalism | Deyi's Applied Learning Programme (ALP) – AC3TIVE VOICE BROADCAST JOURNALISM - commenced in 2016 and introduces students to the basics of Broadcast Journalism, which develops and strengthens language literacy, critical thinking and communication skills. The programme covers Mass Communication &amp; Media, ICT in Information Gathering, and Writing &amp; Presenting. Students collaborate to produce infographics and videos on a wide range of topics that are broadcast to the school, thereby experiencing a deeper engagement with language on authentic platforms to become competent, confident and effective communicators.<br><br>The desired outcomes we envision for all Deyians in the area of ALP are:<br><br>• To be critical inventive thinkers and effective communicators in the areas of broadcast and Journalism.<br>• To be able to produce digital multi-media resources to communicate and broadcast fact, opinions and perspectives.<br>• To be able to communicate persuasively through spoken and written media. |
| Leadership | In Deyi, we are committed to developing leaders who are active contributors to the community, equipped with 21st century skills, and possess a passion to serve. We will be looking for individuals who have shown aptitude in service and leadership in their primary schools or one who has keen interest in community service and would like to lead in this aspect.<br><br>Students who are selected can expect to have their leadership skills and values developed through a mentoring programme. They will be paired with our Student Council Exco members to plan and execute a project to influence our community in exhibiting kindness. The project will be guided by teachers in-charged of student leadership and regular reflections will be facilitated to help them crystalise their learning.   <br><br>Our Uniformed Groups (NCC, NPCC &amp; SJB) are all sustained Gold Units which have achieved outstanding performance in Zonal &amp; National Competitions [e.g. Precision Drill Squad competition (NCC) and 1st Aid &amp; Home Nursing competition (SJB).] |
| Sports and Games | The Deyi student athlete is a sportsperson of character whose pursuit of excellence is unwavering. By participating in sports, students can develop enduring positive character traits and sportsmanship which can prepare them for future, authentic situations. The Deyi athlete is the embodiment of the school values - dedication, diligence, determination, discipline, care and integrity.<br><br>The school has traditionally done well in Zonal and National competitions. The Basketball Girls team has won the Zonal title 3 times in the past decade. The Table Tennis (Girls &amp; Boys) have both achieved top 4 placing in the Zonal tournament. Additionally, our Handball Girls team (made up of students from the various sports groups) has won the National title a total of 9 times (Under-15/Under-17 Division) since its inaugural season in 2012. <br><br>Student athletes who join our sports development programme can look forward to many opportunities to represent our school in both MOE-sanctioned and external competitions. In doing so, Deyi has nurtured many future leaders who went on to captain their various sports teams in their tertiary institutions as well as represent Singapore in the various international tournaments. |

##### General FAQs on the DSA – Sec Exercise

**1\. What is DSA - Sec Exercise?** <br>
The DSA-Sec Exercise was first introduced in 2004 as part of MOE's move towards a more flexible and broad-based education system. Under the DSA-Sec Exercise, schools will be able to select a percentage of their students for admission outside of the centralised posting system, via their own selection criteria. These criteria can include diverse academic and non-academic achievements and talents.

**2\. How much flexibility is given to schools to select their students?** <br>
In general, schools can decide on their admission criteria, so long as they are meritocratic and transparent.

**3\. How will the students be admitted into the participating schools?** <br>
Students who meet the school-based admission criteria will be made a Confirmed Offer or placed on the Waiting List by the school. Students given a Confirmed Offer are guaranteed a place in the school, in a course \[Express, Normal (Academic) or Normal (Technical)\] which the student is eligible for. This is based on the PSLE aggregate of the student.

Students placed on the Waiting List are not guaranteed a place and their admission will be based on available vacancies.

Students on the Rejected List are deemed rejected by the school. However, they may still opt for the school during the S1 Posting Exercise.

**4\. Can a student receive more than 1 confirmed offer?** <br>
Yes. MOE will consolidate all the offers the student has received from the various schools in the School Preference Form which will be sent to the student. Candidates who have been identified under the Confirmed List and the Waiting List of a school will be asked to indicate their preference for up to a maximum of 3 schools. This will be done at their Primary schools. Amendments or cancellations will not be allowed after the closure of the Exercise School Preference Stage.

**5\. When will the student know the outcome of his choice?** <br>
Candidates currently studying in our MOE schools will be informed of their DSA allocation results together with the release of PSLE results through their primary schools. Other candidates (currently not studying in our MOE schools) will have to collect their DSA allocation results from MOE HQ Customer Service Centre, located in 1 North Buona Vista Drive, Podium Block MOE Building, S(138675).

Successful DSA Candidates will be issued with a Direct Admission Slip, informing them of the school that had accepted them. These students will not be allowed to make any school selection in the centralised S1 Posting Exercise. Unsuccessful DSA Candidates will also be issued with a S1 Option Form, informing them that their DSA application had been unsuccessful. These students must complete their S1 Option Form and submit it to their primary school.

**6\. Will there be enough places for students who wish to enrol in the school via the Sec 1 Posting Exercise?** <br>
As there is a cap of&nbsp;20%&nbsp;for Deyi Secondary's enrolment under DSA-Sec exercise there will still be 80% of places available for enrolment under the Sec 1 Posting Exercise.
