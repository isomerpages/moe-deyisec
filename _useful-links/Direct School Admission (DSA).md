### Background <a name="Background"></a>

Starting from the 2018 DSA Exercise (for the 2018 P6 cohort), secondary schools will be able to take in up to 20% of their intake through the DSA. This expansion allows more students to be admitted directly into schools that can better nurture their strengths and interests through specific programmes.

### Centralised DSA-Sec Application Process <a name="CentralisedDSA-SecApplicationProcess"></a>

(NOT applicable for School of the Arts (SOTA) and Singapore Sports School (SSP))
  
Application for DSA-Sec can be submitted through the online DSA-Sec Portal. The application is free-of-charge and will be open from **5 May (11am) to 1 Jun (3.00pm) 2022.** For more details, please refer to MOE website: – [https://www.moe.gov.sg/secondary/dsa](https://www.moe.gov.sg/secondary/dsa)

**Parents and students are encouraged to choose schools wisely based on the student’s aptitudes and strengths, bearing in mind the schools’ academic and non-academic requirements, and the programmes available to develop the area of talent.**
  
**Students who are successfully admitted to the school via DSA are expected to honour their commitment to the school, and participate in the activities related to the talent they are selected for from year 1-4.**
  
**In addition, they will NOT be allowed to transfer to another school after the release of the PSLE results.**
