\* New talent areas offered for DSA Exercise 2022

The following is the write up of the various specific talent areas offered by Deyi for the Direct School Admission (DSA) exercise.

| | | |
|---|---|---|
| Visual and Performing Arts | Since 2005, the Performing Arts have been an area of strength in Deyi. In 2016, we integrated our arts education programmes with our Learning for Life Programme (LLP) - NURTURING CONFIDENT COMMUNICATORS AND GRACIOUS CITIZENS THROUGH THE ARTS. The LLP focuses on real-life experiential learning to develop students’ character and values through various in-curriculum Arts programmes such as Drama, Dance, Visual Art and Music.   To develop every child to the fullest, Deyi aims to bring the Performing Arts to the entire school population.   The desired outcomes we envision for all Deyians in the areas of LLP are: <br><br>• To be more culturally aware and appreciative of the various forms of performing arts; <br>• To learn at least one 'performing art' skill (i.e. to be able to dance, act or sing reasonably well); <br> • To perform in at least one school / public performance. Thus Performing Arts @ Deyi is about values inculcation, holistic development of the child, expanding the common space amidst our rich and diverse cultural heritage and fostering social responsibility so that our students will become Active Learners, Gracious Citizens. All selected students will be recruited into Visual & Performing Arts-related CCAs namely, Art Club, School Band, Choir, Movement & Dance, and English Drama Club for a customised Talent Development Programme. |
| Media/Journalism | Deyi's Applied Learning Programme (ALP) – AC3TIVE VOICE BROADCAST JOURNALISM - commenced in 2016 and introduces students to the basics of Broadcast Journalism, which develops and strengthens language literacy, critical thinking and communication skills. The programme covers Mass Communication & Media, ICT in Information Gathering, and Writing & Presenting.   Students collaborate to produce infographics and videos on a wide range of topics that are broadcast to the school, thereby experiencing a deeper engagement with language on authentic platforms to become competent, confident and effective communicators.<br><br>The desired outcomes we envision for all Deyians in the area of ALP are:<br>• To be critical inventive thinkers and effective communicators in the areas of broadcast and Journalism.<br>• To be able to produce digital multi-media resources to communicate and broadcast fact, opinions and perspectives.<br>• To be able to communicate persuasively through spoken and written media. |
| Leadership | In Deyi, we are committed to developing leaders who are active contributors to the community, equipped with 21st century’s skills, and possess a passion to serve. We will be looking for individuals who have shown aptitude in service and leadership in their primary schools or one who has keen interest in community service and would like to lead in this aspect.<br><br>Students who are selected can expect to have their leadership skills and values developed through a mentoring programme. They will be paired with our Student Council Exco members to plan and execute a project to influence our community in exhibiting kindness. The project will be guided by teachers in-charged of student leadership and regular reflections will be facilitated to help them crystalise their learning.   <br><br>Our Uniformed Groups (NCC, NPCC & SJB) are all sustained Gold Units which have achieved outstanding performance in Zonal & National Competitions [e.g. Precision Drill Squad competition (NCC) and 1st Aid & Home Nursing competition (SJB).] |
| Sports and Games | The Deyi student athlete is a sportsperson of character whose pursuit of excellence is unwavering. By participating in sports, students can develop enduring positive character traits and sportsmanship which can prepare them for future, authentic situations. The Deyi athlete is the embodiment of the school values - dedication, diligence, determination, discipline, care and integrity.<br><br>The school has traditionally done well in Zonal and National competitions. The Basketball Girls team has won the Zonal title 3 times in the past decade. The Table Tennis (Girls) came in 4th in the Zonal tournament in 2019. Additionally, our Handball Girls team (made up of students from the various sports groups) has won the National title a total of 9 times (Under-15/Under-17 Division) since its inaugural season in 2012. Student athletes who join our sports development programme can look forward to many opportunities to represent our school in both MOE-sanctioned and external competitions. In doing so, Deyi has nurtured many future leaders who went on to captain their various sports teams in their tertiary institutions as well as represent Singapore in the various international tournaments. |
