<h1>Integration Programme</h1>
<p>This year, the Integration Programme at Deyi Secondary School experiences
a revitalizing and refreshing transformation! The program has set its sights
on embracing and empowering secondary 1-3 international students and permanent
residents.</p>
<p>Our mission is to achieve a multitude of crucial objectives which include
the following: Firstly, it seeks to enhance awareness of significance of
integration for the overall success of both our society and nation. By
fostering a sense of togetherness, we believe we can build a stronger and
more harmonious community. Secondly, the Integration Programme is dedicated
to helping newcomers adapt seamlessly to the Singaporean way of life. This
includes providing support to help them better grasp local cultures and
social norms, ensuring they feel at home in their new environment.</p>
<p>A key aspect of the program involves creating opportunities for local
and international students to form friendships and share experiences. To
facilitate this, we have organized learning journeys to culturally enriching
destinations like museums and local attractions. Additionally, our innovative
buddy system, led by supportive student leaders, fosters a sense of camaraderie
among the students.</p>
<p>Lastly, one of our primary goals is to instill a profound emotional attachment
and a sense of belonging to Singapore among the students. By creating a
welcoming and inclusive environment, we aim to make the learning experience
joyful and meaningful.</p>
<p>Through these concerted efforts, we are committed to maximizing the potential
of every student, empowering them to become successful individuals who
can contribute positively to society.</p>
