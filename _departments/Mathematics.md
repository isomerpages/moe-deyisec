**Vision:** <br>
To nurture Passionate Learners, Creative Thinkers and Effective Problem Solvers
<br>
**Mission:**<br>
Exploring new Angles through Mathematics
<br>

The Mathematics Department plans for learning opportunities where students can stretch their learning. Our Lower Secondary students participated in the Learning Festivals Activities such as 3D Tic Tac Toe Competition and Tower of Hanoi Competition where students competed on their logical thinking and problem solving skills. These activities extended studentsâ€™ learning in class such as the topic on Number Pattern in a different environment through a different experience.

Secondary 3 students also had the opportunity to catch a glimpse of their post-secondary pathways and careers through a Financial Literacy Programme.

For Principles of Accounts (POA), the focus was on the use of gamification and employing real-life scenarios to increase students' engagement and motivation in the learning of the subject.

&nbsp;**POA Quest 2023**
 
A total of 80 Superheroes from 20 secondary schools gathered at Deyi Secondary for a POA Quest on 31 May to flaunt their amazing accounting knowledge and abilities. They surmounted challenges like Jewel Heist, Wheels of Assets, POAkemon, Online Escape Rooms, POA Pinballs and Debate to show their accounting prowess.

Each station was designed and helmed by our Deyi Sec 4 Game Masters who led each team with enthusiasm and zest.

Great hospitality was extended by our Sec 3 POA Chaperones to every team and they were also inspired seeing their seniors in action.

Everyone was soaked in the accounting atmosphere and at the end of a 3-hour battle, 3 winners emerged!

Congratulations to Bukit Merah Sec (Champion), New Town Sec (First Runner-Up) and Bedok Green Sec (Second Runner-Up). Felicitations, once again, to them and kudos to all our sec 3 and 4 accounting students for making this memorable experience possible!
