<p><strong>Vision:</strong> 
<br>To nurture Passionate Learners, Creative Thinkers and Effective Problem
Solvers
<br><strong>Mission:</strong> 
<br>Exploring new Angles through Mathematics
<br><strong>Approach:</strong>
</p>
<p>The Mathematics Department at Deyi Secondary School provides learning
opportunities for students to expand their knowledge. During the Learning
Festival, our Lower Secondary students engaged in activities such as the
3D Tic Tac Toe Competition and Tower of Hanoi Competition, honing their
logical thinking and problem-solving skills. These experiences allowed
students to apply their understanding of Number Patterns in a different
context, enriching their classroom learning. Additionally, Secondary 3
students participated in a Financial Literacy Programme, gaining insights
into post-secondary pathways and careers.</p>
<p>In Principles of Accounts (POA), we focus on enhancing student engagement
through gamification and real-life scenarios. Recently, 80 students from
20 secondary schools gathered at Deyi Secondary for a thrilling POA Quest,
showcasing their accounting knowledge and abilities. The event featured
challenges like Jewel Heist, Wheels of Assets, POAkemon, Online Escape
Rooms, POA Pinballs, and Debate, all designed and led by our enthusiastic
Deyi Secondary 4 Game Masters. Our Secondary 3 POA Chaperones provided
excellent support, and our Secondary 3 and 4 POA students made this memorable
experience possible. Kudos to all for their outstanding participation!</p>
