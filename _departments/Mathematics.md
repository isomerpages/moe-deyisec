<p><strong>Vision:</strong> 
<br>To nurture Passionate Learners, Creative Thinkers and Effective Problem
Solvers
<br>
<br><strong>Mission:</strong> 
<br>Exploring new Angles through Mathematics
<br>
<br><strong>Approach:</strong>
<br>The Mathematics Department plans for learning opportunities where students
can stretch their learning. Our Lower Secondary students participated in
the Learning Festival’s activities such as 3D Tic Tac Toe and Tower of
Hanoi where students tapped on their logical thinking and problem-solving
skills. These activities extended students’ learning in class such as the
topic on Number Pattern in a different environment through a different
experience.</p>
<p>For Principles of Accounts (POA), the focus was on the use of gamification
and employing real-life scenarios to foster a stronger sense&nbsp;of&nbsp;motivation
and discover the joy&nbsp;of&nbsp;learning for the subject. On 29 May,
a total of 80 Superheroes from 20 secondary schools gathered at Deyi Secondary
for a POA Quest to flaunt their amazing accounting knowledge and abilities.
They surmounted challenges such as Escape Room,&nbsp;POA&nbsp;Board Games,
Jeopardy and Debate to show their accounting prowess. Each station was
designed and helmed by our Deyi Secondary 4 and 5 Game Masters. Great hospitality
was extended by our Secondary 3 POA Chaperones to every team. Our students
received overwhelming response from both teachers and student participants
for their&nbsp;creativity in designing their&nbsp;POA&nbsp;Games and their
confidence in facilitating them.</p>
<p>We are also proud of our students’ achievements in various competitions.
For the Ngee Ann Polytechnic Math Challenge, our teams emerged gold and
bronze in three different categories. For the Animation and Game Making
Competition, Lim Yee Kiat Bernard clinched the Platinum award for the game
category, showcasing his ability for computer applications and his ability
to present his game development. For the National Financial Literacy Challenge
2024 participated by 40 schools with a total&nbsp;of&nbsp;320&nbsp;POA&nbsp;students,
our team fought hard and secured the fourth position. For the “Catching
Insomina” Challenge organised by Central Provident Fund (CPF) board, our
accounting students clinched the fifth position amongst a total of 12 secondary
schools and polytechnic teams. Our accounting students also represented
our school well in National Accounting Challenge and&nbsp;ACCTraordinary
(Accounting Avengers) 2024.</p>
