**Vision:** <br>
To nurture Passionate Learners, Creative Thinkers and Effective Problem Solvers

**Mission:** <br>
Exploring new Angles through Mathematics

The Mathematics Department plans for learning opportunities where students can appreciate the relevance of math in real-world situations. For example, to broaden students’ learning experiences and foster students’ interest in the subject, the Secondary 2 students are challenged to design Math games, culminating in a game carnival for their peers.

There were opportunities for Secondary 1 students to stretch their learning. Our students participated in the Learning Festivals Activities such as Scratch Coding and Logic Games Competition. These activities helped students to strengthen their logical thinking and problem solving skills. They also extended students’ learning in class such as the topic on Number Pattern in a different environment through a different experience.  

Our students embarked on a Financial Literacy Youth Series Programme at the year-end Learning Festival. The Secondary 1 students learnt about the importance of saving while the Secondary 2 students learnt about the importance of budgeting. The Secondary 3 students had the opportunity to catch a glimpse of their post-secondary pathways and careers  

The Secondary 3, 4 and 5 students went through a Digital Literacy Programme which equipped them with skills for the Digitalisation Industry. They learnt programming and data analytics skills.  

For Principles of Accounts, the focus was on the use of gamification and employing real-life scenarios to increase students' engagement and motivation in the learning of the subject. This year, Deyi hosted 10 Secondary Schools in its inaugural National POA Quest 2022. Our Secondary 4s POA students facilitated the sessions which included debates and game stations.&nbsp;
