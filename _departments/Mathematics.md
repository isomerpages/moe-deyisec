**Vision:** <br>
To nurture Passionate Learners, Creative Thinkers and Effective Problem Solvers
<br>
**Mission:**<br>
Exploring new Angles through Mathematics
<br>

The Mathematics Department at Deyi Secondary School provides learning opportunities for students to expand their knowledge. During the Learning Festival, our Lower Secondary students engaged in activities such as the 3D Tic Tac Toe Competition and Tower of Hanoi Competition, honing their logical thinking and problem-solving skills. These experiences allowed students to apply their understanding of Number Patterns in a different context, enriching their classroom learning. Additionally, Secondary 3 students participated in a Financial Literacy Programme, gaining insights into post-secondary pathways and careers.

In Principles of Accounts (POA), we focus on enhancing student engagement through gamification and real-life scenarios. Recently, 80 students from 20 secondary schools gathered at Deyi Secondary for a thrilling POA Quest, showcasing their accounting knowledge and abilities. The event featured challenges like Jewel Heist, Wheels of Assets, POAkemon, Online Escape Rooms, POA Pinballs, and Debate, all designed and led by our enthusiastic Deyi Secondary 4 Game Masters. Our Secondary 3 POA Chaperones provided excellent support, and our Secondary 3 and 4 POA students made this memorable experience possible. Kudos to all for their outstanding participation!
