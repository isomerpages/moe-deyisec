### Growth Mindset in Deyi

Everybody can be motivated. The key lies in helping students adopt a positive attitude and unlocking their potential. In Deyi Secondary, we embarked on inculcating our students with Growth Mindset skills, knowledge and values since April 2021. We are working on a school-wide experience of developing a growth mindset among students and teachers for learning and teaching.   
  
<u> What is Growth Mindset? </u> <br>
American psychologist Prof. Carol Dweck, one of the world’s leading researchers in the field of motivation, believes that students adopting the right mindset is key to keeping them motivated. Her research discusses two types of mindsets: growth and fixed. She found that people with a growth mindset are able to embrace challenges and persist even when they fail. They believe in putting in effort to achieve mastery, learn well from criticism, and find lessons in the successes of others. People with fixed mindset believe that talent and intelligence are predetermined by nature and in fiite supply.


<u> Nurturing Growth Mindset in Deyians </u> <br>
The Growth Mindset modules that are carried out during CCE lessons, seek to instil in our students habits and strategies for them to take on challenges, overcome obstacles, develop grit, appreciate feedback positively, and see the success of others as an inspiration rather than threat. The strategies taught will enable our students to break away from their fixed mindsets and reap higher growth in their learning. Students learn that the brain is malleable and therefore, intelligence is not fixed. They are equipped with the skills to examine their methods, in tandem to their effort, in order to achieve high growth.

As Deyians approach learning and their future endeavours with a Growth Mindset, they will be able to focus more on their personal growth and find joy in their learning. This will help Deyians bounce back stronger and strengthen their mental health.
