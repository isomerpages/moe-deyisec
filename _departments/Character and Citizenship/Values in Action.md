**Values in Action** <Br>
Values in Action (VIA) is a key student development experience that enhances students’ development of their identities as socially responsible citizens through ownership of their contributions to the community. Our VIA approach enables Deyians to progressively contribute to the school, society and overseas community through **Action**, building **Awareness** and being **Advocates** for those who are in need.

This year, our Deyians prepared goodie bags for Bus Captains at Serangoon Bus Interchange to show support to frontline staff who continue to keep Singapore moving during this challenging period.
