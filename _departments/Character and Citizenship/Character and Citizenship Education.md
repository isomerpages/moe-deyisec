<p>Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) is at the heart of education
in Singapore. Through our CCE lessons and student development experiences,
Deyians learn values, social-emotional competencies, and develop character
and citizenship dispositions that enable them to grow holistically and
learn for life.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Through CCE, Deyians learn to be responsible to family and community,
and understand their roles in shaping the future of our nation, by exploring
their&nbsp;Identity, their&nbsp;Relationships&nbsp;with the people around
them and the&nbsp;Choices&nbsp;they make.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our school-based CCE programmes aim to develop our Deyians as Active Learners
and Gracious Citizens, by inculcating values and helping them develop competencies
for the 21st century.</p>

Together.</p>
