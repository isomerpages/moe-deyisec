### Education and Career Guidance (ECG)

ECG aims to:  
* nurture student’s self-awareness and self-directedness for lifelong learning;
* enable students to explore education and career options, by equipping them with accurate and comprehensive information;
* help students develop a growth mindset and a resilient attitude to embrace future opportunities, and appreciate all occupations across society; and
* create opportunities for students to build positive connections with the community (such as teachers, ECG counsellors, parents, industry partners), to develop an appreciation for different career pathways.

Choosing one's education or career path is one of the most important yet difficult decisions to make. Our students need to be able to make well-informed choices by talking to parents, teachers and school counsellor about their education and career aspirations. They can also explore and gather information via the MOE Education and Career Guidance e-portal at [https://www.myskillsfuture.gov.sg/content/student/en/secondary.html](https://www.myskillsfuture.gov.sg/content/student/en/secondary.html)
