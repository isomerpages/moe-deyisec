### Education and Career Guidance (ECG)

ECG aims to:  
* nurture studentâ€™s self-awareness and self-directedness for lifelong learning;
* enable students to explore education and career options, by equipping them with accurate and comprehensive information;
* help students develop a growth mindset and a resilient attitude to embrace future opportunities, and appreciate all occupations across society; and
* create opportunities for students to build positive connections with the community (such as teachers, ECG counsellors, parents, industry partners), to develop an appreciation for different career pathways.
