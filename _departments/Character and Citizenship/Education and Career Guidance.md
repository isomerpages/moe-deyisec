### Education and Career Guidance (ECG)

ECG aims to:  
* nurture student’s self-awareness and self-directedness for lifelong learning;
* enable students to explore education and career options, by equipping them with accurate and comprehensive information;
* help students develop a growth mindset and a resilient attitude to embrace future opportunities, and appreciate all occupations across society; and
* create opportunities for students to build positive connections with the community (such as teachers, ECG counsellors, parents, industry partners), to develop an appreciation for different career pathways.

**MySkillsFuture Student Portal - Support for Our Students** <br>
Choosing one's education or career path is one of the most important yet difficult decisions to make. Our students need to be able to make well-informed choices by talking to parents, teachers and school counsellor about their education and career aspirations. They can also explore and gather information via the MOE Education and Career Guidance e-portal at&nbsp;[https://www.myskillsfuture.gov.sg/content/student/en/secondary.html](https://www.myskillsfuture.gov.sg/content/student/en/secondary.html)

**ECG Counsellor**<br>
Students can make an appointment with the ECG Counsellor via the email at [Lim\_Siew\_Hoon\_Linda@schools.gov.sg](mailto:Lim_Siew_Hoon_Linda@schools.gov.sg) . The ECG counsellor is based in the library and will be at Deyi on Tuesdays and Thursdays.

**Careers Day**<br>
Careers Day for our Sec 4 and 5 graduating students: Our second time collaboration with National Youth Council and The Astronauts Collective enabled them to explore and discover meaningful careers. The students kickstarted their day with ice-breaking games, followed byJob Taster segment interacting with professionals ranging from Investigation Officer to Growth Director and much more. It allowed students to gain insights on how each job contributed to the world they are living in. To have a better sense of possible education pathways after their GCE N and O Level examination, students went on a Career Advising Trip in the afternoon to Nanyang Polytechnic and ITE College (West and East).

Girls in Tech (GIT), a cross-polytechnic student-initiated interest group that is supported by the five polytechnics, organised a talk to interested Secondary 2 to 4 students to ignite their passion for innovation and creativity in the tech world! While targeted at girls, the GIT Team were welcoming to our boys who were interested in the sector. The involvement of our three ex-Deyians from GIT added a relatable aspect, inspiring our current Deyians.
