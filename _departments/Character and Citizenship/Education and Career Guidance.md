### Education and Career Guidance (ECG)

ECG aims to:  
* nurture student’s self-awareness and self-directedness for lifelong learning;
* enable students to explore education and career options, by equipping them with accurate and comprehensive information;
* help students develop a growth mindset and a resilient attitude to embrace future opportunities, and appreciate all occupations across society; and
* create opportunities for students to build positive connections with the community (such as teachers, ECG counsellors, parents, industry partners), to develop an appreciation for different career pathways.

**MySkillsFuture Student Portal - Support for Our Students** <br>
Choosing one's education or career path is one of the most important yet difficult decisions to make. Our students need to be able to make well-informed choices by talking to parents, teachers and school counsellor about their education and career aspirations. They can also explore and gather information via the MOE Education and Career Guidance e-portal at&nbsp;[https://www.myskillsfuture.gov.sg/content/student/en/secondary.html](https://www.myskillsfuture.gov.sg/content/student/en/secondary.html)

**ECG Counsellor**<br>
Students can make an appointment with the ECG Counsellor via the booking link at https://go.gov.sg/ecg-deyibooking . The ECG counsellor is based in the library and will be at Deyi on Tuesdays and Thursdays.


**Career’s Day 2023 : Our Focus**<br>
1. To enable students to explore, discover and create meaningful careers.

3. To allow students:<br>
    (a)	To have more career options beyond their familiarity and knowledge.<br>
    (b)	To have a better sense of the possible education pathways.

This year's Careers Day for our Sec 4 and 5 graduating students enabled them to explore and discover meaningful careers. This was made possible with our collaboration with National Youth Council and The Astronauts Collective.<br>

The students kickstarted their day with a Job Taster segment interacting with professionals ranging from Healthcare Research Data Analyst to Social Media Content Creator and much more. It allowed students to gain insights on how each job contributed to the world they are living in.<br>

Students had an opportunity to hear from unique professions such as Privacy Technologist, Charity Chief in Human Career Library segment via zoom.<br>

To have a better sense of possible education pathways after their GCE N and O Level examination, students went on a Career Advising Trip in the afternoon to Nanyang Polytechnic and ITE College ( West and East).<br>
