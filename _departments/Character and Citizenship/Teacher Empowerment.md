<p><strong>Every Teacher, A CCE Teacher</strong> 
<br>In Deyi Secondary, our teachers are given opportunities to learn with
one another, and from teacher leaders who model sound CCE practices and
mentor them for professional growth. Teachers are given time and opportunities
to critically reflect on CCE, and find ways to transform and deliver learning
experiences.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We have professional development sessions for CCE teachers focused on
Growth Mindset and Facilitation of Contemporary Issues. Time is also set
aside for teachers to look at the new CCE 2021 lessons and collectively
brainstorm ideas on how the new CCE 2021 lessons can be enacted with students
in a Full SBB class.</p>
<p>We have three Specialised CCE Teachers who are specially trained to co-facilitate
teaching of complex topics with Form Teachers as well as lead in school-based
learning community discussions.</p>
<p><strong>Our Specialised CCE Teachers are:</strong>
