<p><strong>Department Philosophy:</strong> 
<br>Our department believes that students can be engaged through Play and
learn through Experience without Learning. Through playing, the department
hopes to achieve 100% engagement from both students as well as staff. The
department believes that if everyone finds it fun to engage in physical
activities, there is a greater chance for all to pursue a healthy lifestyle
beyond school. Through experiences in sports participation, students can
develop enduring positive character traits and sportsmanship which will
help them deal with future real-life situations that require dedication,
diligence, determination, discipline, care and integrity.</p>

<p><strong>Annual Track Meet</strong>
</p>
<p>Our school track meet shone a light on the grit and spirit of our students.
They raced with all their might, jumped as high as they could, and put
their strength into every throw. The bright day echoed with cheers, as
every determined step and leap was supported by peers and mentors. These
snapshots capture the perseverance that defines our students and the encouragement
that fuels them. It was a proud day that celebrated not just athletic skill,
but the enduring heart of our school's culture.</p>
