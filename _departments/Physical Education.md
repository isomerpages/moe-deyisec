**Department Philosophy** <br>
Our department believes that students can be engaged through Play and learn through Experience without Learning. Through playing, the department hopes to achieve 100% engagement from both students as well as staff. The department believes that if everyone finds it fun to engage in physical activities, there is a greater chance for all to pursue a healthy lifestyle beyond school. Through experiences in sports participation, students can develop enduring positive character traits and sportsmanship which will help them deal with future real-life situations that require dedication, diligence, determination, discipline, care and integrity.
