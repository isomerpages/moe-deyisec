<p>In Deyi Secondary School, our AC<sup>3</sup>TIve Learning Framework (2016)
guides the process of teaching and learning and is in tandem with the educational
focus of promoting a student-centric values-driven holistic education,
with the articulation of curricular outcomes to guide the development of
these strategies.</p>

<h4>Teaching &amp; Learning Philosophy</h4>
<p>The framework is premised on Prof David Jonanssen’s (1995, 2005, 2013)
ICT research on the qualities of learning, and is tagged to the School’s
Vision of “Active Learners”, translating in out own unique Deyi’s AC<sup>3</sup>TIVE
Learning Framework. The 7 core qualities of learning are as follows:</p>

</div>
<p>These 7 qualities of learning are interconnected as indicated by the inter-connected
lines, and crystallize into a solid inner core right in the center of the
entire framework.&nbsp;This guides teachers in teaching and students in
learning as it clearly conveys that learning is active, constructive, collaborative
contextual, transferable, intentional, and reflective.</p>
<p>The circle representing the assessment of and for learning outlines the
cycle of planning, support, evaluation and improvement towards our outcomes.</p>
<p>The important enablers form the cornerstones of our framework, namely,
a Conducive Learning Environment, Competent Caring Staff, Efficient Resource
and Information Management and Supportive Partnerships.</p>
<p>Finally, the square frame has as its fundamental foundation anchored upon
the School Vision of “Active Learners, Gracious Citizens”, the School Mission
of “inspiring Lives, Nurturing Talent, Realizing Dreams”, and the School
Values IC4D&nbsp; - Integrity, Care, Dedication, Diligence, Determination
and Discipline.&nbsp; The top border directs the outcome of the AC<sup>3</sup>TIVE
Learning Framework –“ Every Deyian a Confident Person, a Self-Directed
Learner”.</p>
