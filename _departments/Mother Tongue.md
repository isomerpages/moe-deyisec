<p><strong>Vision:</strong> 
<br>Confident Deyians who embrace their own ethnic identity.</p>
<p><strong>Mission:</strong> 
<br>To develop and deepen students’ Mother Tongue language skills and appreciation
of their roots and cultures through a wide range of programmes and activities,
which allow them to apply their language skills as well as to connect with
their own cultural heritage.</p>
<p><strong>Approach:</strong>
<br>The Mother Tongue syllabus aims to engage students in joyful learning
and develop them to become active and proficient users of MTL, with the
three broad objectives: Communication, Culture and Connection. Teachers
will build on students’ prior knowledge and skills of listening, speaking,
reading, writing, as well as spoken and written interaction to enhance
their communication skills; guide them to understand and appreciate various
cultural and literary materials to strengthen their global and cross-cultural
awareness; and create opportunities for them to learn and use the various
language skills in authentic situations beyond the classroom.</p>
<p>This year, the Mother Tongue Languages Department organised many activities
and festive celebrations, with the addition of refreshing elements such
as the Dragon Dance and Mask Changing performances during the Chinese New
Year Concert; the Mother Tongue teachers’ Chinese New Year Music Video;
the Kompang Training Workshop in conjunction with the Hari Raya Celebration;
as well as mask making and bamboo slip writing during the Mother Tongue
Languages Fortnight. During the Mid-Autumn Festival Night, new cultural
experience booths and traditional food booths like the Dragon Beard Candy
and Ding Ding Candy were introduced. For Deepavali, there was a photo booth
with the provision of Indian costumes and oil lamp painting as fringe activities.
In addition, the Mother Tongue Language students enjoyed cultural performances
at the theatres. They also had the opportunity to participate in different
workshops and national competitions to acquire new knowledge and skills,
as well as to hone their language skills. Based on the positive feedback
from the students and the bright smiles on their faces, it was evident
that they had benefitted from all these learning opportunities.</p>
