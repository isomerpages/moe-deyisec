<p><strong>Vision:</strong> 
<br>Engage. Empower. Excite</p>
<p><strong>Mission:</strong> 
<br>Every Science student would
<br>1. Attain 21st Century Competencies to prepare for the future.
<br>2. Appreciate the nature of science through acquiring scientific literacy.
<br>3. Attain of Knowledge, Process Skills and Core Competencies.
<br>4. Develop character and display school values.</p>
<p><strong>Approach:</strong> 
<br>In Deyi, students go through experiential learning, inquiry-based learning,
problem-based learning and game-based learning.
<br>
<br>This involves students leveraging on technology to gain scientific knowledge
coupled with science practical hands-on learning. Through the use of specialized
learning spaces like the Aquaponics Greenhouse, Vertical farming and the
Butterfly Garden, our students gain first hand experiences related to Science.
<br>
<br>Enrichment programmes, learning journeys, and participation in Science
competitions provide real-world applications of scientific knowledge.
<br>
<br>In Deyi, STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math) activities promote
insights into practical application of science in real life which nurtures
students' curiosity, critical thinking, and appreciation for the value
of science through immersive and authentic learning experiences.</p>
