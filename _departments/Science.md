**Vision:** <br>
Inquiring Minds, Innovative Spirit  
  
  
**Mission:** <br>
To equip our students with scientific skills for life-long learning.    
  
The Science Department aims to nurture students who are curious about the natural world around them. Teachers make use of authentic demonstrations, practical sessions and games to enthuse their students in the learning of science. Students also get to experience science in our learning spaces such as the Aquaponics Greenhouse and the Butterfly Garden. Teachers also create authentic learning experiences outside the school for our students by organizing enrichment programmes such as Learning Journey to the Science Centre, ABC Water Trail and Advanced Elective Module in Chemistry.
