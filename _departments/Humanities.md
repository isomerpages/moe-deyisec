**Vision:** <br>
Students appreciative of a changing world, past and present 
  
**Mission:** <br>
To engage students in an innovative teaching and learning environment  
  
**Programmes:** <br> 
Made up of subjects such as History, Geography, and Social Studies, the Humanities curriculum offers students a rich tapestry of knowledge about the world and human societies. Our department adopts a holistic approach that enables learners to connect the past, present, and future, fostering a deep understanding of the forces that shape our societies, countries, and the world. 
<br><br>
In addition, by incorporating inquiry-based learning as a key pedagogy, we empower students to become active seekers of knowledge, encouraging critical thinking and problem-solving skills. Another key aspect of the learning in Humanities is the Learning Journeys and Fieldwork which enable the students to explore and apply their learning in authentic and practical contexts.

**Learning Festival – Humanities Booth** <br>
The geography unit set up a booth to encourage students to be environmental stewards by spreading environmental messages to fellow Deyians and to consider the importance of sustainable living. They were given the opportunity to express their creativity in delivering such environmental messages through an artform painted on pebbles given to them. <br><br>
The history unit set up a booth to  let the students bask in a board game that is created in house by Deyi’s Secondary a while ago,. This game encourages students to learn more about Singapore’s history and development based on the familiar snakes and ladders game. Students get to learn more Singapore’s exciting journey from a Settlement to a City through by moving through the spaces and through the ‘Uniquely Home’ cards.
