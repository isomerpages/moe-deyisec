<p><strong>Vision:</strong> 
<br>Students appreciative of a changing world, past and present</p>
<p><strong>Mission:</strong> 
<br>To engage students in an innovative teaching and learning environment</p>
<p><strong>Approach:</strong> 
<br>Made up of subjects such as History, Geography, and Social Studies, the
Humanities curriculum offers students a rich tapestry of knowledge about
the world and human societies. Our department adopts a holistic approach
that enables learners to connect the past, present, and future, fostering
a deep understanding of the forces that shape our societies, countries,
and the world.
<br>
<br>In addition, by incorporating inquiry-based learning as a key pedagogy,
we empower students to become active seekers of knowledge, encouraging
critical thinking and problem-solving skills. Another key aspect of the
learning in Humanities is the Learning Journeys and Fieldwork which enable
the students to explore and apply their learning in authentic and practical
contexts.</p>

<p><strong><u>Raffles Policy Dialogue 2023</u></strong> 
<br>Theme: Hustle Culture
<br>A group of student councillors participated in the Raffles Policy Dialogue
on 8 March 2023. With the theme of ‘Hustle Culture’, the dialogue enabled
our student councillors to have the opportunity to understand more about
hustle culture – how it manifests not just at work but even through the
education system, as well as its impacts on society.
<br>
<br>Our student councillors had the chance to exchange ideas and collaborate
with student representatives from other schools to come up with solutions
to address the challenges presented by hustle culture. This was a step
in the right direction for concerned citizens and budding future leaders
of society. Deyi Secondary School submitted 3 projects for the RGS Southeast
Asia symposium organized in October 2023 by Raffles to promote students
agency and interest in Southeast Asia. This symposium showcases students’
artefacts, research work, reflections on Southeast Asia topics.</p>
