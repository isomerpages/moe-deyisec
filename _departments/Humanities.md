**Vision:** <br>
Students appreciative of a changing world, past and present 
  
**Mission:** <br>
To engage students in an innovative teaching and learning environment  
  
**Programmes** <br> 
To foster critical thinking skills, we adopt an inquiry-based learning approach in our teaching of the Humanities.
  
The approach consists of 4 main areas of inquiry:  
* Sparking Curiosity
* Gathering Data
* Reflective Thinking
* Exercise Reasoning
  
To actively engage our students in the inquiry process, Geographical Investigations (GI) and Historical Investigations (HI) of formulating hypothesis, collecting and analysing data and reflection are integral part of our pedagogy. In addition, local and oversea learning journeys (cultural immersion) are also organised to promote authentic and experiential learning.
