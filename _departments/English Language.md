<p><strong>Vision:</strong> 
<br>Develop confident communicators in written, spoken, and performative modes
through 21st century ways of compelling communication.</p>
<p><strong>Mission: <br></strong> Implementing the new EL Syllabus 2020 and
ongoing professional learning with the English Language Institute of Singapore
(MOE/ELIS) to deepen pedagogy.</p>
<p><strong>Approach:</strong>
<br>Here in Deyi, the Applied Learning Programme (ALP) in Broadcast Journalism
is integrated into the English Department's workplan. The English language
and Literature teachers believe in harnessing the 21st century e-pedagogies
of multiliteracies and metacognition to enliven and strengthen teaching.
Visible thinking approaches like text annotation and Padlet (a web 2.0
tool) are also utilised. As a pilot FSBB school where students offer more
demanding subjects like English, Differentiated Instruction (DI) is also
a classroom approach used by our teachers to support learning. Our teachers
are also continuing their collaboration with Principal Master Teacher,
Cedric Leong from ELIS/AST, to explore the use of Artificial Intelligence
(AI) writing tools, as well as the adoption of metacognitive strategies
to enhance our students' multimodal journalism artefacts (Writing and Representing).</p>
