Year 2023 marks 43rd year of the founding of Deyi Secondary School. It also marks the scaling up of the Full Subject Based Banding (FSBB) pilot to the entire school. Full SBB marks the move towards a unified secondary education by offering many subject bands to better meet our students’ learning needs, without labels. This is part of the broader shift in our education system to recognize the strengths and interests of our students, to help them build their confidence and 
develop their intrinsic motivation to learn for life. 

We will continue to anchor our decision making on our values and our belief that everyone matters and can and wants to learn. We are proud that Deyi is a safe and conducive place for learning, and we will continue to enhance the teaching and learning experiences and environment for all.  With our participation in Personalized Digital Learning Programme (PDLP), our students can look forward to more opportunities and experiences in self-directed learning in line with our vision of ‘Active Learners, Gracious Citizens”. Deyians will continue to be developed to be self-disciplined, civic-minded, respectful, and empathetic. Our school curriculum and co-curriculum programmes will continue to be values-driven and future-focused, so that our students are equipped with the 21st Century Competencies (21 CC) and skills to be future-ready.

This year, we will focus more on developing self-directed learners who take initiative and persevere in the face of challenges. We believe that skills and habits of mind can be cultivated, enabling students to shift from being passive observers to active agents, who make guided decisions about their learning for self-growth and development. Students must persist in the face of challenges to exercise initiative and manage student life without overly relying on their teachers.  For this, our students will need to exercise discipline and be equipped with good decision-making skills to navigate the increasingly complex world. With more frequent usage and exposure to social media, we also need our parents to lay down expectations and boundaries for social media use even with the deployment of DMA. This would neatly complement the habits of mind that our teachers will endeavor to inculcate in all students.

We will continue to depend on our caring and committed teachers in helping to unlock the potential of our students, by motivating them to be passionate about learning, and to have high aspirations and noble life goals for themselves.  They will keep an open mind in nurturing and developing our students to be the best that they can be. Teachers too will embrace life-long learning to deepen and enhance their competencies and capacity as reflective practitioners who strive for excellence. Our teachers will endeavour to role model the values and competencies to prepare our students to be future-ready.

As our teachers are the key to unlocking our students’ potential, we will focus on building strong teacher student relationship (TSR), and nurture good peer relationships. We will start the year right by organizing various level camps. Each camp focuses on building different skillsets and competencies and nurturing the disposition and mindset for students to be empowered as self-directed learners. In all this, our pivotal outcome would be to build the sense of inclusiveness and family within the school, which inspires every child to achieve high standards for themselves and their schoolmates.

Every Deyian must have a sense appreciation and consideration for others. With opportunities to have their voices heard while they work in teams to problem-solve and develop communication skills, we are certain that we can develop Deyians into citizens whom we can be proud of. We look forward to our students’ full participation in their educational journey to realize their dreams, undaunted by challenges and steadfast and resilient in their pursuit.
