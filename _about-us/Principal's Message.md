*“If you want to build a ship, don’t drum up the men to gather wood, divide the work, and give orders. Instead, teach them to yearn for the vast and endless sea.”* <br>
\- Antoine de Saint-Exupéry

Having traversed close to five decades, this year Deyi commemorates its 44th year since its founding in 1980.

We have much to be thankful for. Through dedicated efforts and innovative fervour, our teachers and staff have nurtured and developed generations of Deyians to be Active Learners and Gracious Citizens of upstanding character, anchored in values that guide them in word and deed. The many alumni who return to give back to the school, share their life experiences and expertise, attest to their love and pride for the school and for their juniors. This is the Deyi Legacy.

As we stand on the precipice of a world brimming with opportunities and challenges, it is incumbent upon us to recognize the pivotal role each of us plays in shaping the future. We recognize our students’ immense capacity to contribute meaningfully to the world that awaits them, to advocate for a worthy cause and communicate their desire to uplift their fellowman, to better the world. It is our duty as educators to inspire our Deyians to fulfill their dreams and aspirational goals.

Every Deyian possesses an unparalleled potential — a potential not solely confined to personal achievements, but one that extends to the collective progress of humanity. The actions they take today, the choices they make, and the principles they uphold have a resounding impact on the world of tomorrow. Our students’ pursuit of knowledge, and their determination to excel will serve as the cornerstone of a brighter, more prosperous future for their community, where they appreciate diverse perspectives and celebrate peoples, cultures and traditions as they unite as one nation.

Through the school's holistic education, we equip Deyians with 21st-century skills and learning for life dispositions, so that they are future-ready and are able to persevere despite life’s challenges. By providing a safe and empowering learning environment, our students grow and thrive, taking ownership and accountability over their learning. They cultivate self-discipline, respect for self and others, and extend themselves beyond their comfort zone, to explore domains that are untried, untested. These are authentic platforms for Deyians to adapt and exercise adaptive thinking, to push the boundaries of knowledge and seek creative solutions for problems yet to be envisioned. 

Our Deyi Family values every student, every teacher, every staff and every stakeholder. The relationships and rapport we build with each other further strengthens our belief in our people, our shared vision, mission and values. These relationships are responsible for the warm and caring culture in Deyi, and the reason for the deep appreciation and respect our Deyians have for their teachers and staff. 

Our teachers are committed to the development of every child, and to this end they remain steadfast and progressive in their professional growth, leveraging technology and diverse pedagogical approaches to engage, enthuse and inspire young minds. They have been instrumental in the success of the school’s implementation of the Full Subject Based Banding (FSBB) and Personalized Digital Learning Programme (PDLP), and our evergreen Applied Learning Programme (ALP) ‘Active Voice Broadcast Journalism’ and Learning for Life Programme (LLP) Arts Education. Our students can look forward to learning experiences that provide them the necessary skills and mindsets to navigate their passion pursuits.   

We look forward to journeying with our Deyians in their educational journey.

*Today I am proud to be a Deyian. Tomorrow Deyi will be proud of me.*
