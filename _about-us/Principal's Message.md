Year 2022 marks 42nd year of the founding of Deyi Secondary School. It also marks the completion of our second year of piloting Full Subject Based Banding (FSBB). With Full SBB, we are moving towards a unified secondary education, with many subject bands, to better meet our studentsâ€™ learning needs, without labels. This is part of the broader shift in our education system to recognize the strengths and interests of our students, to help them build their confidence and develop their intrinsic motivation to learn for life. In 2022, we will also see our first upper sec classes operating based on FSBB.
