<p><em>“If you want to build a ship, don’t drum up the men to gather wood, divide the work, and give orders. Instead, teach them to yearn for the vast and endless sea.”</em>
<br>- Antoine de Saint-Exupéry</p>
<p>Every Deyian possesses an unparalleled potential — a potential not solely
confined to personal achievements, but one that extends to the collective
progress of humanity. The actions they take today, the choices they make,
and the principles and values they uphold have a resounding impact on the
world of tomorrow. Our students’ pursuit of knowledge, and their determination
to excel will serve as the cornerstone of a brighter, more prosperous future
for their community, where they lead by example, appreciate diverse perspectives
and celebrate peoples, cultures and traditions as they unite as one nation.</p>
<p>Through the school's holistic education, we equip Deyians with 21st-century
skills, learning for life dispositions, so that they are future-ready and
are able to persevere despite life’s challenges. By providing a safe and
empowering learning environment, our students grow and thrive, taking ownership
and accountability over their learning. They cultivate self-discipline,
respect for self and others, and extend themselves beyond their comfort
zone, to explore domains that are untried, untested. These are authentic
platforms for Deyians to adapt and exercise adaptive thinking, to push
the boundaries of knowledge and seek creative solutions for problems yet
to be envisioned.</p>
<p>Our Deyi Family values every student, every teacher, every staff and every
stakeholder. The relationships and rapport we build with each other further
strengthens our belief in our people, our shared vision, mission and values.
These relationships are responsible for the warm and caring culture in
Deyi, and the reason for the deep appreciation and respect our Deyians
have for their teachers and staff.</p>
<p>Our teachers are committed to the development of every child, and to this
end they remain steadfast and progressive in their professional growth,
leveraging technology and diverse pedagogical approaches to engage, enthuse
and inspire young minds. They have been instrumental in the success of
the school’s implementation of the Full Subject Based Banding (FSBB) and
Personalized Digital Learning Programme (PDLP), and our evergreen Applied
Learning Programme (ALP) ‘Active Voice Broadcast Journalism’ and Learning
for Life Programme (LLP) Arts Education. Our students can look forward
to learning experiences that provide them the necessary skills and mindsets
to navigate their passion pursuits.</p>
<p>We look forward to journeying with our Deyians in their educational journey,
just as Deyi makes strides towards its 50<sup>th</sup> year in 2030.</p>
<p><em>Today I am proud to be a Deyian. Tomorrow Deyi will be proud of me.</em>
