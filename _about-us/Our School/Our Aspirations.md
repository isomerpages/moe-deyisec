Deyi is about our people.

Deyians come from diverse backgrounds and have different aspirations. Yet they all have unique talents. Guidance is given to nurture Deyians to develop their capacity to contribute actively and meaningfully to society.

Deyians are given many opportunities to develop their talents and work towards their aspirations. Through the Learning for Life Programme (LLP), the school seeks to nurture confident communicators and gracious citizens via the different art forms and with the Applied Learning Programme (ALP), the school aims to develop and strengthen studentsâ€™ language literacy and communication skills through Broadcast Journalism. Deyi is an enriching place where students discover the joy of learning and form lasting friendships as they work together for the betterment of the larger community.

Today, many cohorts of students are proud to be associated with Deyi. As they continue to grow to take their place at home and in society, Deyi is proud of them.
