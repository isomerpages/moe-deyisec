_INSPIRING LIVES, NURTURING TALENT, REALISING DREAMS_

Deyi Secondary School (formerly known as Teck Ghee Secondary School) was started in 1980 with the primary focus of making quality education accessible to the community in the then growing new town of Ang Mo Kio. The school adopted the motto: ‘Dedication and Integrity’, with the objectives of guiding students to be morally upright and academically driven.

As the school embraces change, it will continue to anchor itself to its core mission of inspiring lives, nurturing talent and realising dreams. The school aims for all students to continue the legacy left behind by their alumni. Students will develop a strong sense of purpose throughout their journey here in Deyi, and empower future batches of students to strive for greater heights.
