<h4><strong>School History</strong></h4>
<p>Deyi Secondary School (formerly known as Teck Ghee Secondary School) was
established in 1980 with the aim of making quality education accessible
to the community in the then growing new town of Ang Mo Kio. The school
adopted the motto ‘Dedication and Integrity’, with the objective of guiding
students to be morally upright and academically driven.&nbsp;Deyi is guided
by the philosophy that every child entrusted to the school is a gem, and
that the teachers’ role is to help students fulfil their fullest potential
and realise their dreams.</p>
<p>Deyi has a wide range of distinctive programmes including the Active Voice
Broadcast Journalism Programme, which introduces students to the basics
of broadcasting and journalism, strengthening language literacy, critical
thinking and communication skills. Deyi’s AC3TIve Framework provides impetus
to the school’s Mi-Ke-Mon curriculum innovation project. It adds a fun
twist on language acquisition with engagement in pen-it-down and mike-it-up
tasks, which foster the joy of learning across a range of subjects and
topics. The school’s arts education seeks to nurture gracious contributing
citizens with its signature drama-in-curriculum modules.</p>
<p>The Youth Social Entrepreneurship Programme is an exciting collaborative
platform that engages students with social issues and problem-solving skills
to help beneficiaries through hands-on community service projects. Deyi’s
Student Leadership Development Programme develops every student into confident
leaders who contribute actively. Together with learning journeys, field
trips, experiential learning as well as education and career guidance conducted
in partnership with institutes of higher learning, the school’s students
are prepared holistically for the future.</p>
<p>Deyi relocated to its present premises at 1 Ang Mo Kio Street 42 in 2002.
In 2015, the school celebrated its 35th anniversary.</p>

<p>The school crest reflects the broad objective of the school, which is
to provide an all-round education for its students. This is represented
by the circle. The four D’s stand for dedication, determination, diligence
and discipline – qualities that will enable students to meet the challenges
in life.</p>
<p>The colour white signifies purity and integrity; blue symbolises the persevering
Deyi spirit, which is all-pervasive like the sea; and yellow represents
the students and staff striving for excellence.</p>
<p>From these emerge individuals of upright character and integrity, who
will strive for success in all endeavours.</p>
