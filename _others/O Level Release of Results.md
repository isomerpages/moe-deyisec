raw ELMAB3 aggregate<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;of 12 points or lower and meet the
subject-specific requirements for their chosen course.</p>
<p>&nbsp;19. PFP-eligible students will receive a copy of&nbsp;<u>Form&nbsp;P</u>&nbsp;from

how GCE O-Level results are considered in the computation of the ELMAB3
aggregate, can be found on the PFP website indicated above.</p>

<p><strong><u>Direct-Entry-Scheme to Polytechnic Programme (DPP)</u></strong>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;21. The DPP<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;prepares students for progression into
selected polytechnic diploma courses via a two-year&nbsp;<em>Higher Nitec&nbsp;</em>course
at ITE. Students are eligible to apply if they obtain a raw ELMAB3 aggregate
of 19 points or lower and meet the subject-specific requirements for their
chosen course.</p>
<p>&nbsp;22. Eligible Secondary 4 N(A) students may submit their DPP applications
online via the DPP application portal&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>at&nbsp;</u>www.ite.edu.sg/apply-for-ite-courses</a>.
Applications for the DPP will open from 12am on Friday, 10 January 2025,

a place in the PFP will be on Friday, 31 January 2025. Students will be
informed by the respective polytechnics on the enrolment dates for the
PFP.</p>
<p>&nbsp;26. Students who have accepted a place in the earlier application
phase of the DPP in December but decide to take up a PFP offer now must
withdraw from the DPP first before they are able to take up the PFP offer.
DPP-enrolled students should check with their ITE class advisor for more
details on the DPP withdrawal process and deadlines for withdrawal.</p>
